Buffett's Long-Term View Holds
The stock's momentum aligns with Buffett's long-standing investment philosophy, as outlined in Berkshire's latest annual letter to shareholders.
The 93-year-old billionaire emphasized the company's patient, long-term approach: “Over time, we think it highly likely that gains will prevail – why else would we buy these securities? – though the year-by-year numbers will swing wildly and unpredictably. Our horizon for such commitments is almost always far longer than a single year. In many, our thinking involves decades. These long-termers are the purchases that sometimes make the cash register ring like church bells.”
Buffett also highlighted Berkshire's role as a major taxpayer, noting that the company has paid more in corporate income tax than any other U.S. firm in history, including tech giants with trillion-dollar valuations. In 2024 alone, Berkshire made four payments to the IRS totaling $26.8 billion, accounting for about 5% of all corporate taxes paid in the U.S.
Berkshire's Top Holdings
According to Berkshire's latest 13F filing as of December 2024,

AAPL,Apple Inc.,Intel Rallies After Naming Chip Veteran Lip - Bu Tan as CEO,20250314T091500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-names-chip-industry-veteran-204753745.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Intel Corp. jumped 15% after the company named Lip-Bu Tan as its next chief executive officer, entrusting a former board member and semiconductor veteran with one of the toughest jobs in the chip industry.

The Scary Thing About the Wildfire That Was Stopped
Tan, 65, will assume the role on March 18, the company said in a statement Wednesday. He will rejoin the board as well after stepping down in August 2024.
Tan, the former head of Cadence Design Systems Inc., is tasked with restoring the fortunes of a pioneering chipmaker that’s become an industry laggard. Intel, which dominated the semiconductor field for decades, is struggling with market-share losses, manufacturing setbacks and a precipitous decline in its earnings. It’s also burdened with debt and recently had to slash about 15,000 jobs.
The announcement stoked optimism from investors, who sent the stock up to $23.70 in New York on Thursday, marking the biggest single-day gain in nearly a month. Bank of America Corp. analysts also upgraded the shares to “neutral,” citing Tan’s “solid track record.” Through Wednesday’s close, the stock had declined more than 50% over the past 12 months as the company’s future became increasingly murky.
In a memo to Intel employees, Tan said he’s confident he can turn the business around.
“That’s not to say it will be easy. It won’t be,” he said. “But I am joining because I believe with every fiber of my being that we have what it takes to win. Intel plays an essential role in the technology ecosystem, both in the US and around the world.”
Tan’s predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was pushed out by the board for a perceived failure to rejuvenate Intel’s product lineup. One of the most glaring challenges: creating an artificial intelligence accelerator chip that can rival the products of Nvidia Corp. That company, once in Intel’s shadow, has seen its revenue and valuation skyrocket over the past two years due to the AI computing boom.
“This is good for Intel,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein. “If I had to pick somebody, Lip-Bu would have been at the top of that list.”
Gelsinger had also set out to turn Intel into a chip foundry — a contract manufacturer that makes products for outside clients — but that effort is still in its early stages.
Tan signaled that he would continue down that path. “We will work hard to restore Intel’s position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before,” he said in the memo, which was posted on the company’s website. “That’s what this moment demands of us as we remake Intel for the future.”
Story Continues
Intel remains one of the world’s biggest chipmakers by revenue, with more than $50 billion in annual sales. Its processors are the main component in more than 70% of the world’s personal computers and server machines. And the company’s factories still represent a large chunk of worldwide capacity for advanced manufacturing.
But slip-ups in product development have allowed rivals to gain an edge. Besides Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has won market share in PCs and servers — and is better poised than Intel to make inroads in AI chips. In the shadow of those challenges, Intel isn’t even in the top 10 chip industry companies worldwide by market value.
For More: Big Take: How Intel Lost Its Edge (Podcast)
Tan, a Malaysian-born executive, grew up in Singapore, where he attended Nanyang University and studied physics. He later went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gaining a masters in nuclear engineering. He gave up his studies for a doctorate in that field and left for the University of San Francisco, where he got an MBA.
After working in venture investing, he joined the Cadence board in 2004. He became co-CEO in 2008 after incumbent Michael Fister left and then took sole possession of that role in 2009. Tan ran the company for more than a decade before moving to the position of chairman, which he occupied until 2023.
Cadence, along with rival Synopsys Inc., dominates the market for computer-aided design used to create semiconductors. Their software and services have become increasingly important with the rise in complexity of the devices. Engineers use their products to create blueprints for the arrangement of tens of billions of transistors and connecting wires — the underlying architecture of the tiny components.
Running Intel would have once been the most prestigious position in the industry. In its heyday, Intel’s profitability was unusually high for a manufacturing company. Its gross margin — the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production — was north of 60%. The benchmark is currently languishing at about half that level.
When Gelsinger took the helm in 2021, he was seen as a potential savior of the company. But Wall Street soured on his turnaround plan after a string of disappointing quarterly results — including an August 2024 report that analysts described as the worst in its history.
In 2024, Intel was by far the lowest performer on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, declining 60%. As the company’s valuation plummeted back to 1990s levels, the once-unthinkable idea of an Intel takeover has become more plausible.
Intel’s new leader will have to navigate approaches from suitors and decide whether to stick with Gelsinger’s stance that a breakup is unnecessary. Some on Wall Street have suggested splitting up the company’s chip-design and manufacturing units, which are already separated operationally.
Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Arm Holdings Plc have explored the idea of acquiring all or part of Intel, Bloomberg News has reported. If formal approaches are made, Intel’s board will be under pressure to consider scenarios that Gelsinger may have rejected.
Separately, the Trump administration approached rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and asked it to consider taking a stake in a spinoff of Intel’s factories. Under that proposal, which Bloomberg News reported on last month, TSMC would run the plants and reconfigure them to use its technology — something that might make them more attractive to outside customers. Intel’s plants currently focus primarily on its own designs.
The plan also included trying to get TSMC’s biggest clients — a list that includes Qualcomm, AMD and Apple Inc. — to invest in the Intel spinoff. But that report was followed a week later by TSMC’s announcement at the White House that it would increase investments in its own complex in Arizona. That suggests it would prefer not to get involved in outside projects.
Santa Clara, California-based Intel is the biggest recipient of grants from the US government under the Chips and Science Act, a Biden administration push to reinvigorate domestic semiconductor production.
The Chips Act money, totaling nearly $8 billion, is contingent on Intel completing milestones, including the building and equipping of new factories around the US. Intel has already delayed some of its building plans, including for a complex in Ohio. President Donald Trump also has spoken out against the program.
Intel Chairman Frank Yeary said in a separate statement that Tan could leverage his experience reinventing Cadence. Tan “drove a cultural transformation centered on customer-centric innovation,” he said.
“During his time as CEO, Cadence more than doubled its revenue, expanded operating margins and delivered a stock price appreciation of more than 3,200%,” Yeary said. “He also knows Intel well, both as a partner when he ran Cadence and having recently served on our board.”
If Tan can’t orchestrate a similar turnaround at Intel, said Bernstein’s Rasgon, “it was probably unfixable.”

The Shenzhen-based company, which got its start as a spinoff from Huawei Technologies Co., announced a new corporate strategy that centers on building a device-centric AI ecosystem at Mobile World Congress. The funds for its investment push will come from the company and its investors, an Honor representative said, without providing further details. Honor’s biggest backers are local government entities and it also has display maker BOE Technology Group Co. and two of China’s mobile carriers among its investors.
Newly appointed Chief Executive Officer James Li, flanked by representatives from partners Qualcomm Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, set out the company’s plan at the mobile industry’s biggest gathering in Barcelona on Sunday. Honor didn’t specify what it will spend the money on, apart from saying it’ll collaborate with global supply chain and carrier partners, like Orange and Telefonica, to co-create “a new paradigm for AI devices in the agentic AI era.”
Honor joins a rush toward AI across industries, which has been especially pronounced in China following the breakthrough debut of DeepSeek’s reasoning chatbot. The country’s major internet companies, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd., have accelerated updates to their AI models and started measuring themselves against the startup’s software. Honor aims to play a role in the contest for users by taking the device as its starting point.
The company’s approach is also distinctive for its close collaboration with US partners. Honor works with Google Cloud on the development of its AI agent and is integrating Google’s Gemini deeply into its phone software. At MWC, the company also introduced a Windows-powered AI PC in the MagicBook Pro 14, adding to its collaboration with Microsoft Corp.
Questions persist about the monetization potential of new AI technologies and chatbots, with several companies betting on the technology to primarily drive upgrades of hardware. Samsung Electronics Co. made a big push in that direction last year, alongside Apple Inc. with the launch of Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 16. Honor’s effort will have to measure up against those ventures as well as rising domestic competition in China.

AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple sued over  carbon neutral  claim for watches,20250227T160000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sued-over-carbon-neutral-152937021.html,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Apple has been sued by consumers who said its claim that three versions of Apple Watches are ""carbon neutral"" and environmentally friendly is false and misleading.
In a complaint filed on Wednesday in San Jose, California federal court, seven purchasers of the green-tagged Apple Watch Series 9, SE and Ultra 2 said they would not have bought their watches or would have paid less had they known the truth.
Apple, also known for the iPhone, launched the watches in September 2023, saying they would be carbon neutral through a combination of lower emissions and purchases of carbon offsets.
But the plaintiffs--from California, Florida and Washington, D.C.--said two carbon offsetting projects on which Apple relied to meet its corporate emissions target did not provide ""genuine"" carbon reductions.
They said much of the land in Kenya's Chyulu Hills Project lies within a national park protected from deforestation since 1983, while land for China's Guinan Project was heavily covered by trees even before the project began in 2015.
""In both cases, the carbon reductions would have occurred regardless of Apple's involvement or the projects' existence,"" the complaint said. ""Because Apple's carbon neutrality claims are predicated on the efficacy and legitimacy of these projects, Apple’s carbon neutrality claims are false and misleading.""
The plaintiffs also said 70% of U.S. and Canadian consumers consider environmental sustainability crucial when making purchases, citing a study by the National Retail Federation and IBM.
In a statement on Thursday responding to the lawsuit, Apple did not discuss the case but defended its environmental record.
""We've drastically cut emissions for Apple Watch by over 75%, and we are investing significantly in nature-based projects to remove hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon from the air,"" it said. ""We detail our work prominently and transparently for our users.""
The Cupertino, California-based company has aimed to be carbon neutral by 2030, including in its supply chain.
Wednesday's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction blocking Apple from marketing the three watches as carbon neutral.
The case is Dib et al v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 25-02043.

The software giant is seen at the vanguard of this kind of tool, which is designed to handle multi-step processes on behalf of users without human supervision. It launched its Agentforce product in October and introduced a well-received update in December, meaning this report, due after the market close on Wednesday, will be key to the case for its adoption and potential.
A positive read could not only revive the stock, which has trended lower this year, but reassure investors about AI’s potential to drive growth and efficiency more broadly.
“AI agents are now at the forefront of the software trade, and this is the first quarter where we should see hard numbers,” said Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial.
“People are questioning whether the capex spent on AI has been worth it, so if we see tangible results and monetization from Salesforce, that could suggest tech deserves its premiums. If it’s a bad print, that will be disappointing since so much growth has already been baked in.”
Shares fell 0.9% on Tuesday, on track for their fifth straight negative session.
Salesforce’s previous report came in better than expected on key metrics, thanks in large part to AI, sparking a rally that took shares to a record. However, it failed to build on that rally, and is down 17% since that December release.
Last week was the worst for the stock since August, and shares closed at their lowest since November on Monday. The stock is down almost 9% this year, underperforming both the broader market and an index of software companies this year.
Despite that slump, the company is seen as well positioned to deploy AI agents into its software for such functions as customer service, scheduling, and lead scoring. It has been aggressive with the strategy, hiring workers to sell the product even as it cuts jobs elsewhere.
AI agent tools are proliferating; OpenAI released a research-focused one earlier this month. However, Wall Street is positive on Saleforce’s ability to capitalize. Morgan Stanley sees it “in the right place for the shift towards Agentic Computing,” while Scotiabank wrote that checks “highlighted a clear uptick in customers expanding their spend with Salesforce” as a result of Agentforce, although it caveatted that near-term growth “is still an open question” as many customers remain in the testing stage.
Story Continues
According to data compiled by Bloomberg, 75% of software companies have beaten earnings expectations this reporting season, while about 69% have for revenue. For the overall tech sector, the beat rates stand at 84% and 71%, respectively.
That, coupled with the newness of Agentforce and the stock’s recent underperformance, could mean that expectations are low going into this report, while recent management changes may temper how aggressive the company will be with its outlook.
As shares look like a relative bargain among megacap AI stocks, an upside surprise could be a catalyst. The stock trades at 27 times estimated earnings, almost half their 10-year average. It trades at a discount to both the S&P 500 tech sector index and the software index. The stock is 30% below the average price target, making for one of the highest implied returns in tech among the next 12 months.
“The multiple looks pretty reasonable given Salesforce’s stable and predictable growth, especially since you can bank on an inflection in the next couple of quarters from Agentforce,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors, who expects the stock to top $500 over the next couple years, compared with its Monday close just above $308.
He stressed that while near-term results may not show much uplift from Agentforce, the long-term potential is strong, especially if low-cost AI models like China’s DeepSeek accelerate adoption of AI services and functions more broadly.
“Salesforce has always been sticky with its customers, and I think Agentforce is going to be like superglue,” he said. “It is going to build massive momentum, and even if it takes more time than the market hopes, I don’t think anyone doubts this will be a meaningful part of its business over time.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Microsoft Corp. closed at its lowest since September on Monday, the latest sign of how the software titan has struggled in recent months. The stock fell 1% on Monday, after TD Cowen wrote the company has canceled some leases for US data center capacity, raising concerns over whether it’s securing more AI computing capacity than it needs in the long term. Shares are down almost 14% from a peak hit in July.
Top Tech News
President Donald Trump’s move to further decouple economic ties between the US and China rattled global investors, who had bet on a sustained rebound in Chinese stocks.
Trump’s administration is sketching out tougher versions of US semiconductor curbs and pressuring key allies to escalate their restrictions on China’s chip industry, an early indication the new US president plans to expand efforts that began under Joe Biden to limit Beijing’s technological prowess.
DeepSeek has reopened access to its core programming interface after nearly a three-week suspension, resuming a service key to wider adoption of an AI model that’s proven remarkably popular since its emergence last month.

AAPL,Apple Inc.,"Buffett Berkshire Sold Off SPY , VOO Holdings in Q4",20250223T073000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffetts-berkshire-sold-off-spy-012817362.html,"Buffett's Berkshire Sells Entire SPY, VOO Holdings in Q4
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)
sold its entire positions in both the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
and
Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)
during the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Securities and Exchange Commission
filings
released last week, as the investment giant continues its longest selling streak in years.
The decision to fully exit both leading exchange-traded funds rather than maintain smaller positions comes as Berkshire accumulates its largest-ever cash reserve, suggesting Warren Buffett sees limited opportunities in the current market environment despite the S&P 500's strong performance.
The conglomerate sold its entire stake of 39,400 shares in SPY valued at $22.6 million and 43,000 shares of VOO worth $22.68 million, according to a 13F filing. The sales occurred during a quarter when the S&P 500 gained 2.4% and finished 2024 with a 25% return.
""While we don't have insight into their exact reasoning, this could indicate concerns about market valuations, increased volatility, or even a shift toward individual stock selection over broad index exposure,"" according to Daniel Milks, founder of Fiduciary Organization & Woodmark Advisors.
The relatively small positions represented just a fraction of Berkshire's massive portfolio, but the timing of the complete exit from both funds has caught analysts' attention.
""Large investment firms often 'clean up' their portfolios by exiting smaller positions that don't significantly impact overall performance,"" Melissa Caro, founder of My Retirement Network, told etf.com.
Warren Buffett's Market Signal
The sales align with Berkshire's broader strategy of reducing equity exposure, as the company has been a net seller of stocks for nine consecutive quarters, according to the SEC filings. Since these fillings only reflect last year's fourth quarter positions, any potential new moves Berkshire has made in 2025 won't be known until future disclosures.
""What's more notable is that Berkshire sold significant stakes in individual companies that make up a large portion of these ETFs and the broader indices they track. That's where the real attention should be,"" Caro said. ""Selling SPY and VOO doesn't necessarily imply a bearish market outlook, but trimming major individual holdings could signal something about Berkshire's view on specific stocks or sectors.""
Caro noted that Buffett typically recommends index funds for individual investors while pursuing a different strategy for Berkshire, reflecting the distinct advantages and resources available to the institutional investor.
Story Continues
""Given Warren Buffett's history of emphasizing long-term investing, this isn't necessarily a warning sign for retail investors to panic,"" Milks explained. ""Instead, it may reflect Berkshire's preference for direct stock holdings or a belief that certain sectors within the S&P 500 are overvalued.""
In the ongoing battle for ETF market share, SPY has since reclaimed its position as the largest ETF with $636.6 billion in assets, despite experiencing $2.1 billion in outflows over the past five days, according to etf.com data. Meanwhile, VOO has reached $635.2 billion in assets under management, attracting $1 billion in net inflows during the same period.
Rather than simply reducing exposure to one fund, Berkshire's complete exit from both exchange-traded funds comes alongside the accumulation of a record-breaking cash reserve exceeding $300 billion, according to the SEC filings, suggesting a cautious stance amid current market valuations.
The conglomerate has also reduced holdings in financial institutions like
Bank of America Corp. (BAC)
and
Citigroup Inc. (C)
, while maintaining its substantial
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
position, which remains its largest single-stock investment.

Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba surged nearly 60% from a January low through Wednesday on excitement over its artificial intelligence model, co-founder Jack Ma’s meeting with top officials and a tie-up with Apple Inc. That’s come even as the company faces concerns over the impact of fierce competition and China’s struggling economy.
Options traders are predicting a bigger-than-usual stock reaction to the results. Shares have shot past analyst price targets, trading at technically overheated levels and at the highest earnings multiple in two years.
“Fundamentals will have to be back in focus” to drive further gains in the stock, HSBC Holdings PLC analyst Charlene Liu wrote in a note. This includes e-commerce market share stabilization as well as “a clear strategy to monetize AI and accelerate cloud revenue growth and margin improvement.”
Alibaba shares fell as much as 4% in early trading Thursday, ahead of its earnings report.
The DeepSeek frenzy has raised expectations that accelerating AI adoption will boost demand for Alibaba Cloud’s market-leading services. The stock is trading at about 13 times estimated forward earnings, up from less than 9 times just last month.
Alibaba’s valuation could return to its five-year average of 15 times “if its AI story continues to unfold,” said Xiadong Bao, fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. The rally faces challenges, however, including the level of stimulus announced at upcoming government meetings and the start of US tariffs, he said.
The bar to impress the market this earnings season looks high, judging from the negative reaction to Baidu Inc.’s results this week. The shares slid as investors focused on weakness in its core search business despite strong momentum in its AI cloud business.
Alibaba’s results will be parsed for clues on its success in capitalizing on AI demand, while sheltering its earnings from the impact of price competition with rival hyperscalers and e-commerce players.
Analysts estimate sales rose 6.5% in the three months through December, up more than a full percentage point versus both the previous quarter and year-ago period. The consensus expects a net adjusted profit margin of 16.6%, up from 13.2% for the September-ended quarter.
Story Continues
Particular attention will be paid to the cloud business, where analysts project revenue growth of 9.7% for the latest quarter, up from the previous period’s 7%.
Daily options volume surpassed 180,000 contracts in the five days through Tuesday, compared with an average of about 110,000 over the past 20 days. As they bid up bullish contracts, investors are positioned for a 6.1% move in the stock after the earnings, compared with an average gain or drop of 4.8% following the last eight quarterly releases.
In the earnings call, investors will also be looking for signs on whether Alibaba can fend off peers in the burgeoning AI realm. DeepSeek has highlighted how the costs of the technology can be lowered, but it has also raised the threat of easier entry by new rivals.
“While Alibaba is a key AI player among China’s blue chips, it still faces stiff competition from Baidu, Tencent and Huawei,” said Manish Bhargava, chief executive officer at Straits Investment Management. “Alibaba Cloud is a strong contender in AI infrastructure, but its success depends on execution, regulatory dynamics and market adoption.”

AAPL,Apple Inc.,YouTuber Paffrath ETF Closure :  I Took on Too Much  ,20250214T103000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/youtuber-paffrath-etf-closure-took-224648186.html,"closed
An ETF managed by YouTube financial personality Kevin Paffrath is closing, in part, after Paffrath bet that interest rates would continue falling, and he says, after overextending himself with real estate and other projects.
The
Meet Kevin Pricing Power ETF (PP),
with $34.5 million in assets, will liquidate by Feb. 28, according to a
statement
from Tidal Financial Group, which issued the exchange-traded fund in November 2022 under its previous name Toroso.
The fund, started with $500,000, performed well initially thanks partly to Paffrath’s ability to reach more than two million YouTube subscribers, as well as bets on
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
In a
video
posted Feb. 11, Paffrath said assets soared to around $50 million.
After a September interest rate cut, Paffrath bet on falling interest rates. The
Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bull 3X Shares (TMF)
, a high-risk fund that aims to provide outsized returns on bets on U.S. Treasury Bonds, replaced tech companies as PP’s top holding with a nearly 16% allocation. Interest rates have climbed, crushing Paffrath’s bets.
PP’s price was unchanged over the past year, compared with a 22% gain in the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
.
Overextended YouTuber
The father of seven, whose
website
lists his real estate companies and educational courses along with photos of him with a Tesla Cybertruck and a private jet, said in a tweet that he had overextended himself.
“I took on too much,” he
wrote
on X, saying his priorities are his family, YouTube classes and his HouseHack business. “I made a mistake expanding into too much too quickly.”
He said he lost a personal investment of around $1 million due to fees, lawyers and other costs associated with running the fund.
Paffrath also cited interference from his partners without mentioning Tidal or other firms. He said the partners’ rules forbade him from doing things like boosting the size of his bets on Tesla, and they also didn’t execute trades as quickly as he would have wanted.

AAPL,Apple Inc.,Equal - Weight RSP Outperforms S 500 as Mag 7 Falters,20250206T144500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equal-weight-rsp-outperforms-500-140000053.html,"Equal Weight ETF_Scale_Investing Concept
The Mag 7 look more like the “Lag 7” in 2025, as the
Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP)
has outperformed the traditional market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 index, as mega-cap tech stocks have been a performance drag.
The Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)—led the S&P 500 to two consecutive years of 20%+ returns but have mostly underperformed smallcap and midcap stocks this year.
Through Feb. 4, RSP was up 3% while the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
rose 2.7%, and the
Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS)
lagged both with a 2.3% gain.
The performance story was quite different in 2024, as MAGS rocketed 64%, SPY jumped 25%, and RSP gained less than 13%.
Collectively, the Mag 7 stocks make up 33% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization and contributed over 50% of the S&P 500's gains last year, with an average increase of 63% among them.
Combining for such outsized influence, it’s no surprise that the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 would lag an equal-weight ETF like RSP, as four of the Mag 7 stocks have negative returns thus far in 2025.
Behind the Numbers
RSP’s 2025 outperformance can be attributed to several key factors:
Diversification Benefits:
RSP assigns equal weight to each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500, reducing the concentration risk associated with larger companies. In contrast, the traditional S&P 500 is heavily influenced by a few mega-cap stocks, particularly in the technology sector. When these dominant companies underperform, the equal-weighted approach of RSP can lead to better returns.
Performance of Smaller Constituents:
In 2025, the smaller, mid-sized companies within the S&P 500 have demonstrated strong performance, contributing positively to RSP's returns. The equal-weighted structure allows these companies to have a more significant impact on the ETF's overall performance compared to their influence on the market-cap-weighted index.
Sector Rotation:
Market dynamics in 2025 have favored sectors, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, that are underrepresented in the market-cap-weighted S&P 500. RSP's equal weighting provides broader exposure across all sectors, allowing investors to benefit from gains in sectors that may have less representation in the traditional index.
DeepSeek Selloff:
The introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, significantly impacted the performance of several mega-cap technology companies. DeepSeek's AI Assistant, utilizing its V3 model, has demonstrated capabilities comparable to leading AI models but at a fraction of the development cost. On January 27, 2025, following DeepSeek's announcement, major technology stocks experienced declines, most notably the Mag 7 constituent, Nvidia, which fell 17% that day. Other Mag 7 stocks in the red for 2025 include Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.
Story Continues
The bottom line is RSP's equal-weighted strategy offers more balanced exposure across all S&P 500 constituents, enabling it to capitalize on the strong performance of smaller companies and diverse sectors, leading to its outperformance relative to the traditional S&P 500 Index in 2025.
As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results and investors should consider multiple factors, including their financial goals and risk tolerance, before buying shares of any ETF.

AAPL,Apple Inc.,Palantir Earnings to Test Stock Soaring Valuation After Rally,20250204T050000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-earnings-test-stock-soaring-143506377.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc.’s hefty premium will be in focus when the data analysis software giant reports earnings after the market close on Monday — with the stock trading at levels some see as difficult to maintain.

Rebounding from a slump at the start of the year, the stock on Friday powered to a fresh record high, pushing its valuation to nearly 170 times forward earnings — more than 500% greater than that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100.
With Palantir’s ability to keep delivering significant growth seen threatened by rising competition and a weaker outlook in Europe, scrutiny is on earnings. The firm would have to accelerate growth by 50% for four years to hold its stock price, Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill wrote in a Jan. 30 note.
“With Palantir trading at a significant premium to its peers, we believe any signs of decelerating growth could cause concern and subsequently lead to multiple compression,” Thill said. Palantir shares pared an earlier loss to climb about 1% higher in afternoon trading in New York.
Analysts see more than 30% downside for the stock over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Around its earnings, the implied one-day move for shares is more than 13% in either direction, according to Bloomberg. Wall Street expects the company to report GAAP earnings per share of 3 cents, a decline from the year before, and $776 million in revenue, a 28% jump from the year prior.
Bloomberg Intelligence analysts also see possible hurdles to Palantir’s growth. Momentum from US government contracts and its artificial intelligence platform could get weighed down by competition and softness in its international business, according to analysts led by Mandeep Singh.
Another issue for investors is insider sales — of which Palantir had the most of any S&P 500 Index company in the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Palantir insiders sold about $4 billion in shares in 2024, a record, according to data from the Washington Service, with most sales taking place from September through the end of the year. While that makes up a relatively small portion of the company’s roughly $190 billion market value, who is selling is also important — the list includes early investors Peter Thiel and Chief Executive Officer and Founder Alex Karp.
Story Continues
Some of the selling, much of which is pre-scheduled through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, has continued this year. There’s potential for even more sales to come from top executives. According to Jefferson’ Thill, Karp has already sold around 21% of his overall stake and his current trading plan allows for another 7 million shares to be sold through May 2025.
While bulls will also be focused on growth, some are more optimistic that Palantir can continue its rally even in the wake of a fresh record high.
“The higher stock price puts a little bit more pressure on the continued growth for sure, but last year’s growth was phenomenal,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund. “If they can continue on that trajectory, then the stock price is justified for me.”

But its car-selling business has become a sideshow to Elon Musk’s political prominence.

A large chunk of its mammoth market value has been propped up by hopes it will be among the first to develop and market fully self-driving vehicles. Those expectations were turbocharged by Donald Trump’s election victory, as investors bet the closeness between Tesla’s chief executive officer and the US President will pave the way — ignoring cash flow risks from a possible roll-back of EV incentives.
It’s almost as if the company’s ability to profitably build and sell the cars no longer counts. Trading in the options market suggests investors are preparing for a 7% move in either direction off Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, due after Wednesday’s market close. That would be the stock’s smallest post-results swing since October 2022. Shares fell as much as 3.4% on Wednesday, while the broader S&P 500 Index declined 0.9%.
“The market is behaving as if Tesla’s results don’t matter, and that may catch investors flat-footed in case of a large shock,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. “The electric car business is still about $200 billion in market value, but it is still the funding mechanism for a lot of the actual sideshows.”
The stock has added nearly $600 billion to its market value since reporting the last quarterly numbers. Yet in many ways, Tesla shares have become a vehicle for investors to wager on Musk himself, rather than the company. That has advantages, but also poses risks.
On one hand, the shares are now unencumbered by mundane details of growth and profitability. Earlier this month, the EV-maker reported fourth-quarter deliveries that missed analysts’ projections, and marked the first drop in annual sales in more than a decade. The stock, which is one of the most expensively valued in the S&P 500 Index, fell on the day before quickly rebounding.
The flip side is Tesla is now vulnerable to the twists and turns of a potentially volatile relationship. Musk last week openly questioned if companies that joined the Stargate artificial intelligence venture announced by Trump had the funds to follow through on promises. Trump and the Republican party are generally anti-EV, and the president has ordered his administration to consider eliminating related subsidies and policies.
Story Continues
That can be a major headache for Tesla, which in the third quarter of 2024 generated $739 million in revenue from selling regulatory credits to car manufacturers that need to comply with strict pollution standards. In the quarter before that, it hauled in $890 million. Barclays analyst Dan Levy estimates that about two-thirds of Tesla’s US sales, or 20% of its global sales, benefit from EV tax credits that encourage consumers to buy electric cars. It’s not yet clear how the different subsidies and incentives will be impacted.
“Fundamentals remain secondary versus the broader theme of narrative command for Tesla, which has gone into hyperdrive since the US Elections last November,” Levy wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. “It’s important to note this move has very little to do with EVs, as the Election catalyst is objectively a negative for EVs.”
The pitfalls of ascribing eye-watering valuations to future potentials — be it artificial intelligence or robotaxis — came into sharp focus Monday, when the biggest US technology stocks nosedived on fears that Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek could disrupt the current AI business model.
Between $500 billion and $600 billion of Tesla’s current market capitalization is based on its EV and energy businesses, according to Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally, with the rest pinned on efforts toward self-driving cars and humanoid robots. Calculations by Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, show that over 90% of Tesla’s share price is tied to what the company might do in the future.
Still, some say the very nature of Tesla’s core business can also protect it from a sudden DeepSeek-like shock.
“Any company is subject to disruption, but since the auto manufacturing business has a much longer cycle than computer software/hardware, I think that Tesla’s vulnerabilities will occur a bit more slowly,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.
A look into how traders are positioning for Tesla’s earnings report on Wednesday also shows optimism continues to rule. Citigroup equity and derivatives trading strategist Vishal Vivek estimated that options market positioning was about “7 out of 10 bullish.”
“Musk can engineer a stock rally with just a few words on the conference call even if the fourth-quarter numbers themselves are bad,” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of market intelligence firm Vital Knowledge. “That makes the stock extremely difficult to assess, especially around earnings.”
Tech Chart of the Day
ASML Holding NV surged the most since 2020 after booking orders worth twice as much as analysts expected, as the artificial intelligence boom fuels demand for its chipmaking machines. The Dutch company reported bookings of €7.09 billion ($7.4 billion) in the fourth quarter, it said in a statement on Wednesday. That compares with an average estimate of €3.53 billion by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

Apple Inc.
(NASDAQ:
AAPL
) has had a
turbulent beginning to 2025,
with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.
What Happened:
Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth’s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest performer in the ‘Magnificent 7’ group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.

Apple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock’s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.
“When you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact,”
Todd Sohn
, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC,
told
Bloomberg.
Why It Matters:
Apple’s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline,
Nvidia has now overtaken Apple
in market value.
Despite Apple’s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. ""It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we're anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off,"" said Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC.

AAPL,Apple Inc.,India Tata Electronics buys 60 % stake in Pegatron local arm for iPhone plant,20250125T090000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/indias-tata-electronics-acquires-60-072705119.html,"(Reuters) -Tata Electronics said on Friday it has bought a 60% stake in Taiwanese contract manufacturer Pegatron's India unit that operates an iPhone plant, beefing up the Tata group firm's position as an Apple supplier in a fast growing market.
The stake acquisition in Pegatron Technology India is for Apple Inc's iPhone plant near the southern city of Chennai, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Tata Electronics and Pegatron did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Tata Electronics did not reveal financial terms of the deal.
The company will now have two plants in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and one in neighboring Karnataka, which it took over from Taiwan's Wistron last year.
Apple is increasingly looking to diversify its supply chain beyond China amid geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington.
Last April, Reuters reported that Pegatron had the backing of Apple and was in advanced talks to sell its only iPhone plant in India to Tata as the Taiwanese firm looked to scale back its partnership with Apple.
Tata, one of the largest conglomerates in India, has been expanding into iPhone manufacturing, rivaling Foxconn, the only other iPhone contract manufacturer operating in India.
India's competition regulator earlier in January approved Tata Electronics' plan to buy a stake in Pegatron Technology India.

AAPL,Apple Inc.,Oracle Takes Run at Cloud Big Three With Trump - Backed AI Pact,20250123T133000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-takes-run-cloud-big-105554582.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.

The stock’s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
“This certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn’t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.”
Oracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market’s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999. Shares edged 0.2% higher on Thursday.
The joint venture has a goal of growing to “at least” $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.
However, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic’s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed “a bit chaotic.”
In a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.
“This is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,” Ghriskey said. “It is good to be on Trump’s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.”

A Small, Growing Player
Compared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence — which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.
“This moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. “While there’s probably some hype around Trump’s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren’t exactly cheap anymore.”
While Oracle’s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.
Still, the stock’s rally on the venture news hasn’t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company’s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.
The stock’s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft’s multiple of 31.
Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock’s rally.
“It’s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.”
He added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.
“In terms of value for Oracle, it’s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.”

Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January, as of its last close, putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022.

The company’s flagship handsets, China’s top sellers a year earlier, relinquished the top spot to Huawei Technologies Co., Counterpoint Research found. Apple slipped to third in the world’s largest smartphone arena over the three months, commanding about a sixth of the market. The drop in China drove a global slump of 5% in iPhone sales during the key shopping period.
The decline underscores an uneven debut for the latest generation of iPhones, which started off strong in China before losing momentum. The new devices distinguish themselves with the addition of artificial intelligence upgrades — but in China, most of those new features are still not accessible as Apple seeks out a local partner to provide on-device and cloud AI infrastructure. The company’s in talks with everyone from Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. to startups like Zhipu AI, but no deal has yet been concluded.
“This is the first time since the US ban that Huawei regained the leading position,” Counterpoint analyst Mengmeng Zhang said. “Huawei’s sales increased 15.5% YoY driven by the launch of the mid-end Nova 13 series and high-end Mate 70 series.”
The Mate 70 handsets released during the period are the first to give users the option to use software completely free of US technology, via Huawei’s HarmonyOS Next operating system. Powered by made-in-China chips and following up on the breakthrough Mate 60 of the prior year, the Mate 70 is helping Huawei’s push to reclaim share of the premium segment in China.
The country’s broader smartphone market saw its first decline in sales in the final quarter of 2024, after returning to growth for most of the year.

But the landscape is now changing for the chipmaker.

Competitors and customers are stepping up efforts to take a bigger slice of the artificial intelligence chip market. The sector’s blistering revenue growth is slowing. The Biden White House is looking to limit the sale of Nvidia’s most-advanced chips abroad, although it’s unclear how President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration will handle that.
Sounds scary? None of these risks are deterring investors from betting that Nvidia’s rally could add hundreds of billions of dollars more in market value in 2025 as the deluge of spending on AI computing keeps gaining steam.
“I’m not concerned we’ve seen a peak in Nvidia,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management. “There’s more growth to be had, although we should also see more volatility. The AI revolution is going to be a long road with a lot of potholes.”
That turbulence has been on display recently, with Nvidia shares slumping after a presentation by Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang fell short of investors’ high expectations. The stock dropped for five-straight sessions, shedding 12% since hitting a record on Jan. 6, as of its Tuesday close. It rose 1.7% on Wednesday.
Investors say these kinds of swings come with the territory.
“Nvidia’s stock is always going to be way more volatile than the market,” said Joanne Feeney, portfolio manager and partner at Advisors Capital Management, which raised its price target on the shares earlier this week. “We see it as having multiple years of well-above average growth in earnings, and we do see that as explaining and sustaining the valuation.”
Nvidia shares are projected to rise about 30% over the coming year, according to the average of analyst price targets compiled by Bloomberg. That would give the chipmaker a market value of more than $4 trillion, potentially dwarfing its closest peers Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Its revenue is expected to hit $129 billion in its current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 30, up from $27 billion two years ago.
Story Continues
That said, there are plenty of potential hazards ahead. Here’s a look at the biggest issues Nvidia faces in the coming year:
AI Spending
Nvidia’s rally ultimately depends on demand for AI services. Nearly half its revenue comes from a handful of tech giants who are rushing to add computing capacity. Capital expenditures by Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to hit a combined $257 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $209 billion in 2024. Of course, those plans could change if the companies and their customers aren’t generating the big sales they expected from AI.
“At some point we’re going to need to see new applications drive revenue acceleration for other companies for this investment to continue,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson and one of only eight of 78 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy rating on the shares.
Outside of hardware makers like Nvidia, the most visible AI revenue growth is coming from the big web services providers like Amazon, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure. However, it’s still a relatively small amount compared with how much the companies are spending on developing the technology.
So far, few of the tech giants’ cloud computing customers are seeing significant revenue growth from AI. Salesforce.com Inc. shares have rallied on high expectations for new AI offerings, but the customer relationship management software company hasn’t seen much of a sales boost yet. Palantir Technologies Inc., which makes data analysis software, has said its AI services are driving revenue growth.
“It’s imperative that the hyperscaler customers start generating meaningful returns,” Luria said.
Competition
Nvidia has a virtual monopoly on AI accelerators and is attempting to stay ahead of the competition by speeding up the pace for rolling out new chip lines. Its latest, Blackwell, initially faced manufacturing challenges that slowed its release. But Huang said it’s in full production now and will begin shipping in the current quarter, adding that demand for Blackwell is “very strong” and expected to exceed supply for several quarters.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is probably Nvidia’s closest competitor. But its projected AI accelerator sales of more than $5 billion in 2024 are just a sliver of Nvidia’s expected $114 billion in data center revenue in its current fiscal year. Intel Corp., which is in the midst of a troubled turnaround, is even further behind as weaker than expected orders for AI accelerators have led to sales that the company said won’t reach its target of $500 million for 2024.
Meanwhile, chipmakers Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. are gathering momentum in sales of custom-made semiconductors and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom forecast in December that the market for the AI components it designs will reach as much as $90 billion by fiscal 2027, sending its shares soaring and raising concerns that so-called ASIC chips could take share away from Nvidia.
However, it’s unlikely that those custom chips will hurt Nvidia much given Blackwell’s significant technological advancement, according to Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore.
“Competing directly with Nvidia on cluster level specifications will likely remain a challenge,” they wrote in December.
And then there are the chipmaker’s biggest customers, who are hustling to develop their own semiconductors to avoid Nvidia’s high prices. Amazon has begun shipping the second generation of Trainium, which it aims to string together in clusters of up to 100,000 chips. Alphabet’s Google began building an AI chip a decade ago, and the latest edition is expected to be widely available this year. Microsoft Corp. announced an accelerator called Maia and a central processing unit in late 2023.
Valuation
How much investors will pay for Nvidia’s stock comes down to its growth outlook. With customers set to spend more on hardware and competition still playing catch up, that view looks bright at the moment. The shares are priced at almost 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months, below the average over the past decade of 34 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Still, that valuation requires Nvidia’s profits to continue to boom at a time when growth is slowing and higher costs related to the development of Blackwell are expected to weigh on margins. Nvidia sales are projected to climb 112% in fiscal 2025, 53% in fiscal 2026 and 21% in fiscal 2027. Its gross margin is expected to dip as low as 73% in the current quarter, down from 75% in the previous period, Nvidia said in November. However, it anticipates margins rebounding when production ramps up.
For a company that’s growing as fast as Nvidia, it all adds up to a fair price, according to Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services.
“There’s still plenty of growth left for Nvidia in 2025 and there’s still reason to be interested in the stock,” Yuschak said. “Still, that number depends on bigger and bigger spending. If there are any signs of a slowdown in AI spending, the price investors are willing to pay for Nvidia shares will fall.”

Cook’s compensation grew to $74.6 million in 2024, compared with $63.2 million the prior year, Apple said in its annual proxy filing on Friday. In addition to executive compensation, investors will vote on four outside proposal at the meeting on Feb. 25. The company opposed all of them.
The measure about Apple’s diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, efforts urged the company to consider abolishing the program because it may discriminate against employees and draw lawsuits. The company said the proposal was an inappropriate attempt to restrict Apple’s business operations and that it already assesses legal and regulatory risks.
Cook’s pay was made up of a $3 million base salary, $58.1 million in stock awards, and roughly $13.5 million in additional compensation. The raise mostly comes from an increase in stock award value.
While Cook’s pay is up significantly from last year, it’s still a far cry from his total compensation in 2022, which reached nearly $100 million thanks to stock awards. His pay was cut at his discretion in 2023 after pushback from employees and shareholders.
Apple’s board of directors said it “made no changes to the amount or structure of Mr. Cook’s 2025 total target compensation.”
Other executives, including Apple’s retail chief, former chief financial officer, chief operating officer and general counsel, all made more than $27 million in 2024, representing slight increases from the prior year. Luca Maestri, the ex-CFO, was recently replaced as by Kevan Parekh.

The go-to chipmaker for Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. reported a 39% rise in October-December revenue to NT$868.5 billion ($26.3 billion), based on calculations off monthly disclosures. That compares with an average estimate of NT$854.7 billion.
The strong showing from Taiwan’s largest company bolsters expectations that big tech companies from Alphabet Inc. to Microsoft Corp. will continue to build and upgrade datacenters at a rapid clip to propel AI development. This month, AI server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. reported better-than-expected sales, while Microsoft outlined plans to spend $80 billion this fiscal year on datacenters.
Growth accelerated for TSMC in December, capping 34% revenue growth for 2024. That compares with TSMC’s official target of a 30% annual rise, though that outlook was expressed in US dollar terms. The world’s largest maker of advanced chips has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of a global race to develop artificial intelligence.
TSMC’s market value nearly doubled in 2024, and it now trades in the US at a valuation close to $1.1 trillion. Yet some investors worry about when the AI boom will peter out. While TSMC’s revenue beat, it was just 1.6% higher than the average projection and fell short of the most bullish analyst expectations.
More bearish market observers point to potential over-building, bottlenecks to development such as power shortages, and the persistent absence of a killer AI app or service that will use up all that server capacity. Investors will want to hear TSMC’s outlook for the wider industry when it gives its full earnings report on Jan. 16.
US-listed shares of TSMC were down 1.3% on Friday, tracking a broader pullback in markets — and folllowing news earlier this week on Nvidia facing new chip-export restrictions by the US government.
Beyond Nvidia and the AI arena, the Taiwanese company must grapple with mounting tech market and geopolitical uncertainties in 2025. TSMC remains reliant on Apple’s business, as the main producer of chips for the iPhone. The US company is struggling to galvanize demand for its marquee product in 2025, though many users hope that the gradual addition of AI features will drive the gadget’s next iteration.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
The company’s gross margin is likely to expand to a two-year high of 58%, or more. On the upcoming earnings call, four areas merit attention: First, the outlook for CoWoS advanced-packaging capacity build and revenue, which is likely to give insight into the expected strength for AI chip demand in the coming 12-18 months. Second, progress on the US Arizona fab’s ramp-up, which is critical to meeting the onshoring chipmaking needs of Apple, Nvidia and others. Third, potential margin pressure from weaker demand in 7-, 16-nm and larger mature nodes.
Finally, capital-spending plans for 2025, which will signal TSMC’s confidence in the uptake of its next-generation N2 node.

The US has also erected a web of restrictions to curtail the flow of Nvidia’s most powerful chips to China, with uncertain longer-term ramifications for TSMC’s key customer.
Morgan Stanley expects TSMC to project annual sales growth of low-20% in dollar terms. “TSMC usually guides conservatively at the beginning of the year, and then over-delivers,” analyst Charlie Chan wrote. The company raised its outlook for growth over the course of 2024 and may again be starting from a more conservative position at the start of a new year.
Longer-term, TSMC is pursuing a rapid international expansion. It foresees capital expenditure rising in 2025 from roughly $30 billion over the past year. It’s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That’s on top of construction underway in Japan, Arizona and Germany.

Taiwan Semiconductor’s Kaohsiung Expansion To Boost 2-nm Chip Production
The contract chipmaker aims to complete production of plants in Arizona in 2025 and Dresden in 2027. Construction of Taiwan Semiconductor’s second Japanese factory will likely begin near the Kikuyo plant, the Japan News
reports
.
Taiwan commanded 67% of the global market share in contracted semiconductor manufacturing and nearly 80% in cutting-edge products in 2023, the Japan News cites TrendForce.
Taiwan attempted to shield itself from geopolitical tension by concentrating production on the island. Still, it also remains focused on its geographical diversification to help the world boost its semiconductor base by reducing its dependence on China, whose semiconductor supply chain was disrupted during the 2020 pandemic.
Kumamoto Gov. Takashi Kimura shared with Japan Times the country’s hopes to attract Taiwan Semiconductor’s third plant in the prefecture.
The new plant, located in Kikuyo, began commercializing 12-28 nm technology last December. It caters to
Sony Group Corp
(NYSE:
SONY
), which produces camera sensors for
Apple Inc
(NASDAQ:
AAPL
).
Taiwan Semiconductor is proficient in making general-purpose chips between 12 and 28 nm. However, chip plants in Japan failed to produce semiconductors thinner than 40 nm, prompting them to tap the Taiwanese chipmaker.
Taiwan Semiconductor is building a new plant in Arizona, where commercialization of 4-nm chips will likely begin between January and March. It aims to complete its debut European plant in Dresden in 2027. The plant targets a quadrupolar production plan with principal plants in Taiwan, Japan, the U.S., and Germany.
Meanwhile, some concerns loom in the form of President-elect Donald Trump taking charge on January 20.
The U.S. posted a significant trade deficit with Taiwan in 2023, prompting Trump to verbally attack the country during his presidential campaigns for allegedly depriving the U.S. of the semiconductor industry.
He suggested redemption by slapping tariffs on Taiwan, which can increase the contract chipmaker’s production costs since labor costs in the U.S. are about 30% higher than in Taiwan.

‘ Bruce Lu projected
another year of
robust revenue growth for Taiwan Semiconductor in 2025E, 26.8%, following 29.4% revenue growth in 2024E (all in USD terms). Demand in leading-edge nodes, mainly supported by AI, backed this growth.

AAPL,Apple Inc.,"EWC , Canada ETFs Rise Amid Trudeau Resignation",20250108T221500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ewc-canada-etfs-rise-amid-140000949.html,"Canada Investing - Canadian Flag and Stocks
The
iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC)
rose 0.6% Monday as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced at a
press conference
his resignation after nearly a decade in office, citing the need for new leadership amid political challenges.
Trudeau, who is in his third term as prime minister, said while answering questions after the speech in Ottawa it was time for a ""fresh start in parliament"" in order for the country to navigate ""complex"" times domestically and internationally.
He added the transition will consist of two parts—the pausing of parliament until late March and his ultimate resignation which, Trudeau believes, will ""decrease the level of polarization"" in politics.
Trudeau’s challenges to remain in power escalated in December when his long-time ally Chrystia Freeland suddenly resigned as Canada’s finance minister and deputy prime minister. Freeland and former central banker Mark Carney are among the potential successors considered.
Why Canada ETFs Have Lagged SPY, U.S. Equity
Comparing the largest Canada ETFs like EWC and the
JPMorgan BetaBuilders Canada ETF (BBCA)
to the largest U.S. equity ETF, the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
, the performance of U.S. stocks (13% annualized) is more than double that of Canadian stocks (5.8%) for the past decade.
Canadian stocks have historically lagged U.S. stocks due to several structural and economic factors:
Sector Concentration
The Canadian stock market is heavily weighted toward natural resources, such as energy and mining, and financials, which can limit growth potential compared to the more diverse and innovation-driven U.S. market. The U.S. market benefits significantly from technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary sectors, which have been among the highest-performing industries in recent decades.
Innovation and Growth
The U.S. market is home to many of the world’s largest and most innovative companies, particularly in the technology sector (e.g., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Amazon.com Inc.). Canada lacks a similar breadth of large-cap, high-growth companies, which has constrained overall market returns.
Smaller Market Size
The Canadian market is smaller and less liquid than the U.S. market, which can make it less attractive to global investors. Additionally, the smaller pool of domestic companies reduces diversification opportunities.
Currency Effects
The Canadian dollar’s relative weakness against the U.S. dollar over extended periods has further contributed to the underperformance of Canadian stocks for international investors.
Story Continues
Venture Capital
The U.S. leads globally in venture capital funding and fostering startups, particularly in sectors like technology and biotechnology. Canada’s venture capital ecosystem, while growing, is comparatively underdeveloped.
Global Influence
The U.S. market is seen as a global benchmark, attracting significant foreign investment. This status creates a virtuous cycle of liquidity and valuation growth not as pronounced in Canada.
While Canadian stocks have offered strong performance in specific sectors and periods, highlighted most recently by a respectable 14% gain for broad market Canada ETFs like EWC in 2024, these structural factors explain why they have generally trailed the U.S. market over the long term. SPY gained nearly 25% last year.

AAPL,Apple Inc.,Nvidia Investors Look to Huang CES Speech to Spark Next Breakout,20250106T181500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-investors-look-huang-ces-144652887.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. investors have high hopes that Monday’s speech from CEO Jensen Huang will spark a fresh breakout in the chipmaker’s shares, which just ended at their first record close since November.

Huang is set to take the stage Monday evening at the closely-watched CES trade show in Las Vegas. Nvidia has typically used the event to showcase consumer devices using its chips. However, investors will focus today on any commentary on the Blackwell chip, considered Nvidia’s next major growth driver. Despite seeing robust demand, Blackwell has faced supply constraints due in part to manufacturing challenges that have slowed its rollout.
“The expectation is that Blackwell demand remains very strong,” said Matt Cioppa, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Equity Group. “That could bring the ultimate longer-term opportunity for Nvidia back into focus for the market.”
Investors have reasons to be optimistic. Over the past six months, Huang’s comments about demand for the chips have boosted the stock. In October, he called Blackwell demand “insane,” and in November he said the chips are shipping in the current quarter amid “very strong” demand.
The shares posted a monthly loss in December, but still gained 171% in 2024, making them by far the biggest single driver of the S&P 500 Index’s overall gain. The stock is already up 11% this year, including a gain of 3.4% on Monday. With a market capitalization of $3.66 trillion, it is close to re-overtaking Apple Inc. as the largest company; the iPhone maker has a market cap of $3.7 trillion.
Earnings Disappointment
Yet the stock briefly slumped after Nvidia’s Nov. 20 earnings report. The company’s revenue forecast failed to impress Wall Street, which had become accustomed to projections that topped average estimates by wider margins.
The lull in the shares has come as excitement about AI spending has spread to other areas of the semiconductor industry.
Broadcom Inc. shares have soared more than 30% in the past few weeks after the chipmaker projected a boom in the market for AI components that it designs for data-center operators. Marvell Technology Inc. shares have rallied more than 20% since it reported better-than-forecast earnings on demand for its custom AI chips.
Story Continues
Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore likened the rallies in those stocks to a wealth transfer from Nvidia, whose shares sank for four consecutive days in the wake of Broadcom’s report, shedding more than $200 billion in market value.
Nvidia remains a top pick at Morgan Stanley, with the analysts arguing that the chipmaker will take market share this year. They’re also looking to Huang’s keynote to be a “positive event.”
“The messaging should be the same — Blackwell demand is exceptional, but supply constrained,” they wrote in a research note last month. “By mid-year we remain comfortable that the focus will remain on Blackwell, which will be the driving force behind revenue” in the second half of the year.
High Stakes
Jordan Klein, a tech-sector specialist at Mizuho Securities, sees the CES event and Huang’s keynote as tests of near-term sentiment and risk appetite toward tech.
If the stock drops or treads water in the days following Huang’s remarks, that “would be a modest negative in my view into January,” he wrote. Since the tech earnings season won’t begin until later this month, “investors will have little to measure fundamentals and outlooks until then,” he said.
The stakes for Nvidia shares may be elevated, as its surge has heightened valuation concerns. The stock trades at 19 times estimated revenue, making it one of the 10 most expensive Nasdaq 100 Index components by this metric. It also trades close to 35 times estimated earnings, compared with about 24 for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.
Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investments, remains positive on Nvidia and other large technology stocks, but is bracing for “a lot more choppiness” ahead.
“At some point there is going to be a ‘show me’ moment in 2025 that is going to have to reaffirm the story,” she said. “Valuation is clearly an issue, and it is important to note how extended the valuation is, even if the AI tailwinds remain intact.”

Hon Hai, also the world’s largest maker of Apple Inc. iPhones, reported NT$2.13 trillion ($64.6 billion) of revenue for the past three months. December revenue rose 42%, helping the company known as Foxconn beat analyst expectations. It also forecast “significant” sales growth for the first quarter, helping its shares rise as much as 3.6% in Taipei, their biggest intraday gain in about two weeks.
The company and other Taiwan AI hardware suppliers have enjoyed a boost from massive spending on servers for data centers by the biggest US tech firms like Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. But the lack of a compelling use case for AI so far has been making investors nervous about when the expansion might slow.
Goldman Sachs analysts revised up their 2024 earnings estimate by 1% based on higher-than-expected December revenue. They also raised revenue estimates for this year and the following two years, citing higher AI server revenue.
“The sequential revenue growth in Cloud supports our positive view on the next generation rack-level AI servers shipment ramp-up, and general servers and networking equipment demand recovery,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.
Hon Hai expects revenue from its cloud business, which includes AI servers, to match sales from its iPhone-making division in 2025.
Still, Citi analyst Carrie Liu warned in a note that the stock could experience near-term drag based on a first-quarter outlook from the company that seemed less than market estimates.
The AI market is important for Hon Hai’s effort to diversify its business away from Apple, whose iPhones are seeing muted growth. Apple has historically accounted for over half of the Taiwanese company’s sales.
Hon Hai also aims to break into the electric vehicle market, though that venture has yet to have any meaningful effect on its earnings. The company reached out to Renault SA about a tie-up with Nissan Motor Co., which Renault owns 36% of. For now, that pursuit is on hold as Nissan and Honda Motor Co. negotiate a merger, Bloomberg News reported.

AAPL,Apple Inc.,"2024 ETF Inflows Topped $1 . 1T , Shattering Previous Record",20250104T034500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2024-etf-inflows-top-1-213716213.html,"ETF soar
It’s official: 2024 was a record year for ETF inflows. When all was said and done, $1.12 trillion flowed into U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds during the year, almost double the $600 billion of inflows seen in 2022 and 2023, respectively.
2024’s inflows also handily topped the $900 billion from 2021, the previous calendar year record for inflows.
A strong year for U.S. stock market returns motivated investors to push money into ETFs. The S&P 500 surged by 25% in 2024, nearly matching the 26.3% gain from the previous year. It was the first instance of back-to-back gains of 20% or more for the S&P 500 since the late-1990s.
Unsurprisingly, given the strength in U.S. stocks, investors put most of their money to work in stock ETFs.
Two-thirds of all inflows, or more than $750 billion, went into equity ETFs.
Of that, an incredible $113 billion went into the
Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)
and another $85 billion went into the
iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)
.
2024 marked the first time any individual ETF has seen inflows of more than $100 billion in a calendar year.
VOO now has $584 billion in assets under management, putting it within striking distance of overtaking the $626 billion
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
as the world’s largest ETF (SPY had inflows of around $22 billion in 2024).
The strong returns for the S&P 500 were powered by tech stocks like Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. Those stocks, which have an even greater presence in the
Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)
, rode the AI wave to enormous gains in 2024.
QQQ had inflows of almost $24 billion in 2024.
Fixed Income Lags, Crypto Takes Off
While U.S. stocks celebrated strong returns and inflows, the same can’t be said for fixed-income ETFs.
The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) finished the year with just a 1.3% return. A selloff in bonds at the end of the year erased gains from earlier in the year.
Still, despite the tepid returns, investors put $303 billion into fixed-income ETFs, including $21 billion into AGG and almost $19 billion into the
Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)
.
While bonds struggled in 2024, another asset class took off. Cryptocurrency ETFs, which entered a new era with the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, soared while attracting billions of dollars of inflows.
The
iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)
had inflows of more than $37 billion during the year, propelling its AUM to over $50 billion. The price of the ETF doubled in the same period.
Inflows for the category as a whole totaled $38 billion despite $21 billion of outflows from the
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)
. Previously a quasi-closed-end fund, GBTC’s conversion to an ETF spurred massive outflows as arbitrageurs closed their positions and investors swapped the fund for cheaper alternatives.

GBTC had the largest outflows of any U.S.-listed ETF in 2024. The

A preliminary settlement was filed on Tuesday night in the Oakland, California federal court, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White.
Mobile device owners complained that Apple routinely recorded their private conversations after they activated Siri unintentionally, and disclosed these conversations to third parties such as advertisers.
Voice assistants typically react when people use ""hot words"" such as ""Hey, Siri.""
Two plaintiffs said their mentions of Air Jordan sneakers and Olive Garden restaurants triggered ads for those products. Another said he got ads for a brand name surgical treatment after discussing it, he thought privately, with his doctor.
The class period runs from Sept. 17, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2024. It began when Siri incorporated the ""Hey, Siri"" feature that allegedly led to the unauthorized recordings.
Class members, estimated in the tens of millions, may receive up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, such as iPhones and Apple Watches.
Apple denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.
The Cupertino, California-based company and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to similar requests. They may seek up to $28.5 million in fees, plus $1.1 million for expenses, from the settlement fund.
The $95 million is about nine hours of profit for Apple, whose net income was $93.74 billion in its latest fiscal year.
A similar lawsuit on behalf of users of Google's Voice Assistant is pending in the San Jose, California federal court, in the same district as the Oakland court. The plaintiffs are represented by the same law firms as in the Apple case.
The case is Lopez et al v. Apple Inc., U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-04577.

ETFs such as the $58.5 billion
iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW)
are getting fresh makeovers now that high-flying tech stocks including Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are no longer considered pure
growth
by the indexes the funds track, according to CFRA Research.
Microsoft Corp. and Adobe. Inc. are also among companies no longer categorized as pure growth under S&P Global’s latest rebalancing of its growth and
value
indexes, CFRA’s Aniket Ullal
wrote
. Those companies, along with Advanced Micro Devices Inc., now fall in both camps.
Dozens if not hundreds of exchange-traded fund and mutual fund issuers follow S&P indexes when selecting stocks for their funds, and the firm changes the indexes’ weightings—or rebalances—often to reflect changes in stock prices, growth rates and more.
BRK, JPM Growth Scores Boosted
As a result, investors will get a smaller slug of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft in their growth ETFs. They'll also get larger portions of financial firms since the rebalancing gives Berkshire Hathaway Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and others more of a growth blush while dialing back value characteristics.
The rebalancing is important to investors because it “changes the sector exposure of any ETFs linked to these indices, which impacts their future performance,” wrote Ullal, a member of etf.com’s editorial advisory board.

Source: CFRA
S&P Rebalance: Growth vs Value
S&P rebalances the growth and value indexes based upon a widening or narrowing of a stock’s growth-to-value ratio. While a company moving out of growth suggests a slowing stock appreciation—Apple has surged 9.4% over the past 30 days and IVW itself jumped 3%—S&P looks at a range of factors, Ullal said.
“Although megacap tech names like Apple and Microsoft retain characteristics of growth companies like price momentum, they must have also scored relatively high on some value characteristics such as sales to price ratios compared to other growth firms in the S&P 500 universe like Nvidia, Tesla or ServiceNow,” he wrote in an email.
With their weighting in the S&P 500 Growth Index trimmed, tech’s share of the S&P Value Index has more than doubled, to above 20%, from less than 10% last year, according to CFRA. The tech companies mentioned above have been assigned weightings that are now about evenly divided between growth—a company growing faster than the market average—and value, a stock whose price may not accurately capture the company’s true value relative to the rest of the market.

The stock climbed as much as 1.4% in Taipei on Tuesday, briefly surpassing its November 8 peak, before erasing the gain to end flat. The move came after US chip stocks including key customer Nvidia Corp. rallied overnight. TSMC shares are up 82% this year amid continued investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence trades.
“For us, TSMC remains the best way to play the AI theme without having to pick a winner or a technology, at a reasonable valuation,” said Kevin Net, head of Asian equities at Financiere de L Echiquier. The next catalyst to watch will be Nvidia’s presentation at CES 2025 next month as well as TSMC’s upcoming results and guidance, he added.
With a client list that also includes Apple Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., TSMC has been a major beneficiary of the boom in AI spending. The company is expected to report sales growth of 36% for the December quarter, with a gross profit margin at 58.3%, the highest since 2022.

If You Bought Microsoft Stock 10 Years Ago
The company's stock traded at approximately $46.39 per share 10 years ago. If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 216 shares. Currently, shares trade at $429.03, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $92,483 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Microsoft also paid dividends during these 10 years.
Microsoft's dividend yield is currently 0.78%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $21.59 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $4,654 from dividends alone.
Summing up $92,483 and $4,654, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $97,137. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Microsoft stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 871.37%. In comparison, S&P 500 total return for the same period is 229.97%.
Trending: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art —

MSFT,Microsoft Corporation,Microsoft Invested Nearly $14 Billion In OpenAI But Now Its Reducing Its Dependence On The ChatGPT - Parent : Report,20241227T080000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-invested-nearly-14-billion-000512844.html,"Microsoft Invested Nearly $14 Billion In OpenAI But Now Its Reducing Its Dependence On The ChatGPT-Parent: Report
Microsoft Corporation
(NASDAQ:
MSFT
) is reportedly planning to
reduce its dependence
on
ChatGPT
-maker
OpenAI
.
What Happened:
Microsoft has been working on integrating internal and third-party artificial intelligence models into its AI product,
Microsoft 365 Copilot
, reported Reuters, citing sources familiar with the effort.
This move is a strategic step to diversify from the current underlying technology of OpenAI and reduce costs.
The
Satya Nadella
-led company is also decreasing 365 Copilot’s dependence on OpenAI due to concerns about cost and speed for enterprise users, the report noted, citing the sources.
See Also:
The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year —
for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.
A Microsoft spokesperson was quoted in the report saying that OpenAI continues to be the company’s partner on frontier models. “We incorporate various models from OpenAI and Microsoft depending on the product and experience.”
OpenAI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.
Microsoft 365 Copilot is reportedly yet to prove its return on investment to enterprises. The tech giant has not shared specific sales data on the number of licenses sold.
Why It Matters:
This move mirrors those of other Microsoft business units which have altered the ways they use OpenAI models. For instance,
GitHub
,
acquired by Microsoft
in 2018, added models from
Anthropic
and
Alphabet Inc.'s
(NASDAQ:
GOOG
) (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
)
Google
in October as alternatives to OpenAI's
GPT-4
.
Previously it was reported that company insiders were concerned about Microsoft’s AI strategy being
heavily reliant on its partnership
with OpenAI.
In October, the two companies engaged in talks to decide how Microsoft's $14 billion investment in OpenAI would be converted into equity in the AI firm.
OpenAI plans to remove a clause that restricts Microsoft’s access to its most advanced AI models upon achieving artificial general intelligence, according to a report published in December.

Year-to-date,
Nvidia Corporation

What Happened:
On the day when Nvidia and other chip stocks declined,
Michael Landsberg
, chief investment officer at
Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management
, offered a contrarian view on AI-driven tech stocks.
""I wouldn't buy tech here on the dip,"" Landsberg told Reuters'
Lisa Bernhard
, following Nvidia's GTC 2025 keynote. ""We're in a trend now where the economy is slowing a bit, there's concern about tariffs, and bluntly, everybody and their brother owns these names. So what’s happened is there’s an overexposure to them.""

While analysts remain bullish on Nvidia's long-term prospects—citing a robust product roadmap, AI leadership, and strong demand—Landsberg believes the short-term picture tells a different story.
He added that Nvidia CEO
Jensen Huang
can't simply wave his hand and just kind of get the stock to move higher, noting that macroeconomic pressures and saturation in AI-related holdings are weighing on sentiment.

Why It's Important:
Landsberg's comments highlight growing caution around the AI trade, despite Nvidia’s roadmap extending through 2028 and analysts projecting long-term growth in data center spending.
""There's not really a real impetus to buy,"" Landsberg said, adding that when growth is slowing and tariffs are looming, there are better places to look—like Europe.
A series of announcements at the GTC AI Conference in San Jose, California did little to boost Nvidia Corp.’s stock on Tuesday, as shares fell by 3.43% during regular hours.

NYC Plans for Flood Protection Without Federal Funds
The Bedford, Massachusetts-based company warned in its earnings results that there’s doubt about whether it can continue as a going concern. The firm’s board has begun a formal strategic review to evaluate options, including refinancing its debt and exploring a potential sale, according to the statement. Shares plunged as much as 42% to $3.63 in New York, a record intraday decline for the stock, which made its public debut in November 2005.
Amazon abandoned its plans to buy the Roomba maker last year after clashing with European Union regulators who had threatened to block the deal, demonstrating the intense pressure the tech giant was facing from antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. The fallout for iRobot, which had already been struggling, was swift. Its shares tumbled the most in years, and the company’s market value stood at less than $200 million as of Tuesday.
Carlyle Group Inc. provided a $200 million loan through its private credit arm in 2023 to iRobot, which was burning cash at the time. The financing was intended to provide the company some liquidity while antitrust regulators reviewed the planned Amazon takeover.
Since the Amazon deal never materialized, Carlyle is still holding onto the debt. The lender was able to charge the company 9 percentage points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, well above norms on direct loans when it was inked.
The company is paying a fee in order to amend the loan, according to a Wednesday filing. That will include $3.6 million, or about 2% of the total loan outstanding, which will be paid with additional debt.
The company reported a net loss of $77.1 million in the fourth quarter ended on Dec. 28, according to Wednesday’s statement. At year-end, iRobot held $134 million in cash or cash equivalents, up from the previous quarter but down from the year-ago level. The figure includes a $40 million draw down of restricted cash that iRobot said it planned to use to purchase inventory.
iRobot reported a 44% slide in revenue in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, attributing the decline to promotional spending, the timing of orders from its largest customer for the holiday season and “ongoing competitive challenges that the company is addressing” with new product launches.
Story Continues
Still, it warned that there’s “no assurance that the new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.”

Dollar strength has created headwinds for the US, while improving economic prospects and stimulus measures are providing support in the other two regions.
Analysts have been revising their 2025 earnings growth estimates for the S&P 500 downward since mid-January, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. In contrast, earnings estimates for Europe have been raised.
The shift comes as S&P 500 companies reported the most profit misses since the fourth quarter of 2022, while the MSCI Europe Index saw a smaller miss rate than the previous quarter.
Gloomy economic readings and uncertainty regarding US policy has weighed on estimate sentiment, said Gaurav Mallik, Pallas Capital Advisors’ chief investment officer.
US companies face significant risks from a major drop in government spending, and the Federal Reserve has indicated it’s not rushing to cut rates, said Kristina Hooper, Invesco’s chief global market strategist.
Europe’s economy, meanwhile, surprised on the upside by eking out modest growth in the final quarter of 2024. The European Central Bank is more likely to cut rates this year to stimulate growth. And gaps left by a drop in US defense spending will be plugged by Europe, Hooper said.
A strong US dollar is also eating into American companies’ earnings abroad. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has strengthened about 3% in the past six months, even after weakening this week. McDonald’s Corp. sees dollar strength trimming full-year earnings per share by 20 cents to 30 cents. Amazon.com Inc. took an additional $700 million hit from foreign exchange in its fourth quarter. Uber Technologies Inc. said it expects its top line to suffer, though it’s trying to mitigate the risk.
Companies are navigating growing global turbulence and weakening consumer sentiment because of concerns over tariffs and rising prices. Both Honeywell International Inc. and Walmart Inc. issued disappointing outlooks, citing geopolitics and tempered demand. Lee and Wrangler owner Kontoor Brands Inc. said consumers are “confused” and feeling “under attack.”
Tariffs are likely “modestly priced in” to forecasts, Hooper said, though uncertainties around the duration and scale make it difficult to be precise.
Story Continues
Analysts have raised 2025 estimates for European companies during this earnings season. Potential catalysts for earnings this year include the election victory of a pro-business candidate in Germany and Ukraine peace talks, BI analysts Kaidi Meng and Laurent Douillet said.
Negative earnings per share revisions have stopped since the start of the reporting season in mid-January, Goldman Sachs strategists said in a Feb. 14 note. Upgrades are mainly driven by the retreat of a bearish outlook on European equities, supported by favorable currency moves, Citi analysts said in a Feb. 17 note.
Engine-maker MTU Aero Engines AG, which supplies Airbus SE and Boeing Co. and books most of its orders in dollars, cited favorable exchange rates when it boosted guidance.
InterContinental Hotels Group Plc expects greenback strength to “push the US to travel more overseas again,” Chief Financial Officer Michael Glover said in a recent interview.
Tariffs remain the biggest threat to Europe’s upbeat outlook. Sectors that have seen the sharpest earnings downgrades – autos, chemicals, steel and aluminum — are the most vulnerable to a trade war, Goldman Sachs’ portfolio strategist Lilia Peytavin said.
Elevated energy prices and a lack of dynamism in the economy may also threaten the sustainability of Europe’s earnings gains, Mallik added.
China Recovery, India Slowdown
Asia’s outlook is mixed, with prospects in China brightening, while dimming in Japan and India.
Forecasts for earnings growth in China have lifted modestly amid government stimulus programs, BI said. Major firms including Xiaomi Corp. and Midea Group Co. should benefit from increased consumer subsidies. Better-than-expected results from Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. and Lenovo Group Ltd., coupled with DeepSeek’s breakthrough, also boosted sentiment.
Policies focusing on subsidies and boosting consumer confidence unveiled at China’s National People’s Congress, which got under way this week, are key to improving the long-term earnings outlook, said Cusson Leung, chief investment officer for KGI Asia.
A stronger yen and tariffs on Japanese exports are dampening investors enthusiasm for stocks there. In South Korea, a 25% US levy on steel imports will hurt steelmakers as the US accounts for around 13% of their exports, BI said.
In India, 40 of the companies in the benchmark Nifty 50 index saw the average analyst expectation for the 2026 financial year trimmed after the earnings season, with executives citing a slowdown in domestic demand and rising input costs.
In Southeast Asia, estimates for Singapore banks may be nudged higher on strong wealth demand, better lending and slower Fed easing, BI said.

Sales will be about $1.88 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which runs through April, the chipmaker said in a statement Wednesday. Though that was in line with the average analyst estimate, some projections ranged as high as $2 billion.
Marvell shares fell 20% to close at $72.28 in New York trading on Thursday, their biggest single-day decline since Sept. 27, 2001. The drop left the stock down 35% in 2025.
Marvell has been seen as a key beneficiary of the artificial intelligence computing build-out, and that’s ramped up expectations for the chipmaker. Three months ago, the company delivered better-than-expected results that drove its shares to a record high.
The Santa Clara, California-based company provides chip design services, helping major tech customers develop their own data center semiconductors. These so-called hyperscalers have been beefing up efforts to produce processors internally, aiming to fine-tune their computer networks for artificial intelligence software and services. Amazon.com Inc. is one of Marvell’s largest customers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
AI-related companies suffered a stock rout this year after investors grew worried that customers will slow their spending. Chinese startup DeepSeek added to the concerns when it released an AI model that it claimed was relatively cheap to produce, signaling that the industry may not need as much costly equipment.
“Investors were already very ‘skittish’ about AI names the last few weeks,” Tore Svanberg, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a note. Marvell’s report “probably doesn’t help calm those nerves.”
Broadcom Inc., another chipmaker tied to the AI surge, fell as well in the wake of Marvell’s results. Its stock was down 3.5% in after-hours trading. Broadcom is set to deliver its own quarterly report on Thursday.
Marvell expects earnings of 56 cents to 66 cents a share in the first quarter, excluding some items. Analysts had projected 60 cents.

Earnings grew to 60 cents a share on that basis in the fourth quarter. Analysts had estimated 59 cents. Revenue rose 27% to $1.82 billion, topping the $1.8 billion projection.

OpenAI’s biggest backer has voided leases in the US totaling “a couple of hundred megawatts” of capacity — the equivalent of roughly two data centers — canceling agreements with at least a couple of private operators, the US brokerage wrote Friday, citing “channel checks” or inquiries with supply chain providers. TD Cowen said its checks also suggest Microsoft has pulled back on converting so-called statements of qualifications, agreements that usually lead to formal leases.
Microsoft in a statement on Monday reiterated its spending target for the fiscal year ending June, but declined to comment on TD Cowen’s note.
Exactly why Microsoft may be pulling some leases is unclear. TD Cowen posited in a second report on Monday that OpenAI is shifting workloads from Microsoft to Oracle Corp. as part of a relatively new partnership. The tech giant is also among the largest owners and operators of data centers in its own right and is spending billions of dollars on its own capacity. TD Cowen separately suggested that Microsoft may be reallocating some of that in-house investment to the US from abroad.
“While we have yet to get the level of color via our channel checks that we would like into why this is occurring, our initial reaction is that this is tied to Microsoft potentially being in an oversupply position,” TD Cowen analysts Michael Elias, Cooper Belanger and Gregory Williams wrote.
Microsoft shares were little changed in premarket trading on Monday.
A potential lease pullback by Microsoft raises broader questions about whether the company — one of the frontrunners among Big Tech in AI — is growing cautious about the outlook for overall demand. The company has said it expects to spend $80 billion this fiscal year on AI data centers, and on a late January earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said Microsoft has to sustain spending to meet “exponentially more demand.”
“While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in the company’s statement. “Our plans to spend over $80 billion on infrastructure this FY remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand.”
Story Continues
European stocks tied to the energy sector dropped on the report, which may suggest Big Tech companies will need less power to run their data centers. Schneider Electric SE and Siemens Energy AG slid.
Critics have consistently pointed out a dearth of practical, real-world applications for AI, even as Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have pledged to spend billions on the data centers needed to train, develop and host AI services.
Wall Street stepped up its questions about the massive outlays after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek released a new open-source AI model that it claims rivals the abilities of US technology at a fraction of the cost.
All About DeepSeek and Its Lower-Cost AI Model: QuickTake
Microsoft executives have played down concerns about AI overcapacity. It’s spending more than it ever has in its history, outlays that mostly go to the chips and data centers required to fuel power-hungry AI services.
Rivals have also doubled down on their AI spending commitments. In recent weeks Amazon, Alphabet and Meta have pledged to spend $100 billion, $75 billion and up to $65 billion respectively on AI infrastructure. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said this week it would invest more than 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over the next three years as it seeks to become a leader in the field.
In Friday’s report, TD Cowen’s analysts wrote that their channel checks had unearthed a number of signs that Microsoft is gradually retreating. They learned that Microsoft had let more than a gigawatt of agreements on larger sites expire and walked away from “multiple” deals involving about 100 megawatts each. (Data center capacity is often stated in terms of the power they need to stay up and running.)
TD Cowen said Microsoft used facility and power delays as justification for the termination of leases. That was a tactic rivals such as Meta previously employed when curbing capital spending, the firm wrote.
“To me this all looks and sounds like business as usual,” Mizuho Securities analyst Jordan Klein said in a note. “A company this large and with $80 billion of annual spend has the right to move in and out of data center leases, many of which were never officially signed.”
Large cloud hyperscalers typically use a mixture of leased and owned data centers across many locations, Klein said, so investors should expect some degree of “tweaking” of plans.
Microsoft’s alliance with OpenAI may also be evolving in ways that mean the software giant won’t need the same kind of investments. In January, OpenAI and SoftBank Group Corp. announced a joint venture to spend at least $100 billion, and possibly $500 billion, on data centers and other AI infrastructure.
In January, Microsoft said it would alter its multiyear deal with OpenAI so the AI startup could use cloud-computing services from rival providers. Microsoft, which had been the company’s exclusive cloud provider, still has a right of first refusal when OpenAI seeks computing horsepower to train and run its AI models.

Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, determined to turn Amazon into an AI supermarket, is spending big to retain the company’s edge in cloud-computing services. Still, he warned growth would be “lumpy” owing to challenges securing sufficient hardware and electricity.
“It is true we could be growing faster were it not for some of the constraints on capacity,” Jassy said on a conference call Thursday after the release of fourth-quarter results.
The concerns echo those of rival Microsoft Corp., which last week said its cloud sales growth was hurt because it didn’t have enough data centers to handle demand for its AI products.
Jassy said power capacity and the supply of chips — from third parties and Amazon’s own design unit — are limiting the ability of Amazon Web Services to bring new data centers online. Those constraints will likely ease in the second half of 2025, he said.
Amazon spent $26.3 billion in capital expenditures in the last three months of 2024, the vast majority of which went toward AI-related projects within AWS. Jassy told analysts on the call that the amount was “reasonably representative” of the rate of outlays the company planned to make in 2025.
The company reported that AWS revenue jumped 19% to $28.8 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. It was the third straight period of 19% growth for the cloud unit.
“AWS growth did not accelerate as anticipated and instead matched Q3 levels, indicating that the company is challenged by the same types of capacity constraints facing rivals Google and Microsoft,” said Sky Canaves, an analyst at Emarketer.
Jassy’s warning on AWS growth constraints overshadowed a fairly strong holiday quarter, suggesting the company’s main e-commerce and logistics business is fending off competition from Walmart Inc. and discount upstarts like Temu and Shein.
The shares declined almost 3% as the markets opened on Friday in New York. The stock had previously gained 8.9% so far this year after a 44% jump in 2024.
Story Continues
The AI race will likely weigh down profits. Operating income will be $14 billion to $18 billion in the period ending in March, the Seattle-based company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $18.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. First-quarter sales will be as much as $155.5 billion, compared with an average estimate of $158.6 billion.
While Amazon’s overall quarter was generally positive, “investors immediate concerns are around Q1 guidance, which was below expectations, mostly because of the impact of a big currency drag and the impact of lapping a leap year,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co. The company said the extra day in the quarter in 2024 boosted sales by about $1.5 billion.
Total revenue in the holiday quarter increased 10% to $187.8 billion, slightly ahead of analyst estimates. Operating profit was $21.2 billion, compared with the average estimate of $18.8 billion.
Total operating expenses rose 6.2% to $166.6 billion — marking the eighth consecutive quarter that Amazon’s revenue increased at a higher rate than costs. The company employed more than 1.55 million full- and part-time workers at the end of the quarter, a 2% increase from a year earlier.

AMZN,"Amazon.com, Inc.",Equal - Weight RSP Outperforms S 500 as Mag 7 Falters,20250206T144500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equal-weight-rsp-outperforms-500-140000053.html,"Equal Weight ETF_Scale_Investing Concept
The Mag 7 look more like the “Lag 7” in 2025, as the
Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP)
has outperformed the traditional market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 index, as mega-cap tech stocks have been a performance drag.
The Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)—led the S&P 500 to two consecutive years of 20%+ returns but have mostly underperformed smallcap and midcap stocks this year.
Through Feb. 4, RSP was up 3% while the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
rose 2.7%, and the
Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS)
lagged both with a 2.3% gain.
The performance story was quite different in 2024, as MAGS rocketed 64%, SPY jumped 25%, and RSP gained less than 13%.
Collectively, the Mag 7 stocks make up 33% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization and contributed over 50% of the S&P 500's gains last year, with an average increase of 63% among them.
Combining for such outsized influence, it’s no surprise that the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 would lag an equal-weight ETF like RSP, as four of the Mag 7 stocks have negative returns thus far in 2025.
Behind the Numbers
RSP’s 2025 outperformance can be attributed to several key factors:
Diversification Benefits:
RSP assigns equal weight to each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500, reducing the concentration risk associated with larger companies. In contrast, the traditional S&P 500 is heavily influenced by a few mega-cap stocks, particularly in the technology sector. When these dominant companies underperform, the equal-weighted approach of RSP can lead to better returns.
Performance of Smaller Constituents:
In 2025, the smaller, mid-sized companies within the S&P 500 have demonstrated strong performance, contributing positively to RSP's returns. The equal-weighted structure allows these companies to have a more significant impact on the ETF's overall performance compared to their influence on the market-cap-weighted index.
Sector Rotation:
Market dynamics in 2025 have favored sectors, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, that are underrepresented in the market-cap-weighted S&P 500. RSP's equal weighting provides broader exposure across all sectors, allowing investors to benefit from gains in sectors that may have less representation in the traditional index.
DeepSeek Selloff:
The introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, significantly impacted the performance of several mega-cap technology companies. DeepSeek's AI Assistant, utilizing its V3 model, has demonstrated capabilities comparable to leading AI models but at a fraction of the development cost. On January 27, 2025, following DeepSeek's announcement, major technology stocks experienced declines, most notably the Mag 7 constituent, Nvidia, which fell 17% that day. Other Mag 7 stocks in the red for 2025 include Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.
Story Continues
The bottom line is RSP's equal-weighted strategy offers more balanced exposure across all S&P 500 constituents, enabling it to capitalize on the strong performance of smaller companies and diverse sectors, leading to its outperformance relative to the traditional S&P 500 Index in 2025.
As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results and investors should consider multiple factors, including their financial goals and risk tolerance, before buying shares of any ETF.

Zuckerberg expects Meta to allocate between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital spending, primarily aimed at expanding the company's AI teams and building a new data center. he described the new data center as being “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.” The tech mogul further noted that Meta aims to bring a gigawatt of computing power online by 2025 and is projected to finish the year with over 1.3 million graphics processing units.
Weighing in on the announcement, Munster said Meta’s commitment “exceeds Street estimates of $51B.”
""In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts,"" Zuckerberg said.

According to Munster, the increased investment in AI infrastructure will particularly benefit Nvidia and other hardware players in the short term. In the long term, the higher capital expenditure (Capex) is expected to accelerate the AI flywheel, leading to more innovation, lower usage costs, an increase in customers, and consequently, more investment.
He also issued a reminder, stating, “I believe the market is going higher and the run will end in a spectacular bubble burst.”
Why It Matters
: Zuckerberg’s announcement comes on the heels of Meta’s recent AI advancements. In December, Meta introduced the Llama 3.3 70B, a new AI model that outperforms competitors like
Alphabet Inc.
‘s (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) (NASDAQ:
GOOG
) Google,
OpenAI
, and
Amazon.com, Inc.
(NASDAQ:
AMZN
). This model offers the performance of Meta's largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, but at a reduced cost.

Last year in April, Meta announced its plan to purchase 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by 2024 to fuel its AI initiatives. Zuckerberg then said the 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs were initially intended to enhance Instagram Reels, not to position Meta as a leader in AI technology.
Meanwhile, President
Donald Trump
criticized the European Union (EU) for focusing on U.S. tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google. He accused EU regulators of unfairly targeting these companies, calling their actions “a form of taxation.”

A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.

The stock’s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
“This certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn’t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.”
Oracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market’s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999. Shares edged 0.2% higher on Thursday.
The joint venture has a goal of growing to “at least” $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.
However, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic’s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed “a bit chaotic.”
In a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.
“This is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,” Ghriskey said. “It is good to be on Trump’s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.”

A Small, Growing Player
Compared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence — which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.
“This moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. “While there’s probably some hype around Trump’s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren’t exactly cheap anymore.”
While Oracle’s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.
Still, the stock’s rally on the venture news hasn’t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company’s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.
The stock’s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft’s multiple of 31.
Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock’s rally.
“It’s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.”
He added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.
“In terms of value for Oracle, it’s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January, as of its last close, putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022.

Competitors and customers are stepping up efforts to take a bigger slice of the artificial intelligence chip market. The sector’s blistering revenue growth is slowing. The Biden White House is looking to limit the sale of Nvidia’s most-advanced chips abroad, although it’s unclear how President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration will handle that.
Sounds scary? None of these risks are deterring investors from betting that Nvidia’s rally could add hundreds of billions of dollars more in market value in 2025 as the deluge of spending on AI computing keeps gaining steam.
“I’m not concerned we’ve seen a peak in Nvidia,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management. “There’s more growth to be had, although we should also see more volatility. The AI revolution is going to be a long road with a lot of potholes.”
That turbulence has been on display recently, with Nvidia shares slumping after a presentation by Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang fell short of investors’ high expectations. The stock dropped for five-straight sessions, shedding 12% since hitting a record on Jan. 6, as of its Tuesday close. It rose 1.7% on Wednesday.
Investors say these kinds of swings come with the territory.
“Nvidia’s stock is always going to be way more volatile than the market,” said Joanne Feeney, portfolio manager and partner at Advisors Capital Management, which raised its price target on the shares earlier this week. “We see it as having multiple years of well-above average growth in earnings, and we do see that as explaining and sustaining the valuation.”
Nvidia shares are projected to rise about 30% over the coming year, according to the average of analyst price targets compiled by Bloomberg. That would give the chipmaker a market value of more than $4 trillion, potentially dwarfing its closest peers Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Its revenue is expected to hit $129 billion in its current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 30, up from $27 billion two years ago.
Story Continues
That said, there are plenty of potential hazards ahead. Here’s a look at the biggest issues Nvidia faces in the coming year:
AI Spending
Nvidia’s rally ultimately depends on demand for AI services. Nearly half its revenue comes from a handful of tech giants who are rushing to add computing capacity. Capital expenditures by Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to hit a combined $257 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $209 billion in 2024. Of course, those plans could change if the companies and their customers aren’t generating the big sales they expected from AI.
“At some point we’re going to need to see new applications drive revenue acceleration for other companies for this investment to continue,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson and one of only eight of 78 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy rating on the shares.
Outside of hardware makers like Nvidia, the most visible AI revenue growth is coming from the big web services providers like Amazon, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure. However, it’s still a relatively small amount compared with how much the companies are spending on developing the technology.
So far, few of the tech giants’ cloud computing customers are seeing significant revenue growth from AI. Salesforce.com Inc. shares have rallied on high expectations for new AI offerings, but the customer relationship management software company hasn’t seen much of a sales boost yet. Palantir Technologies Inc., which makes data analysis software, has said its AI services are driving revenue growth.
“It’s imperative that the hyperscaler customers start generating meaningful returns,” Luria said.
Competition
Nvidia has a virtual monopoly on AI accelerators and is attempting to stay ahead of the competition by speeding up the pace for rolling out new chip lines. Its latest, Blackwell, initially faced manufacturing challenges that slowed its release. But Huang said it’s in full production now and will begin shipping in the current quarter, adding that demand for Blackwell is “very strong” and expected to exceed supply for several quarters.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is probably Nvidia’s closest competitor. But its projected AI accelerator sales of more than $5 billion in 2024 are just a sliver of Nvidia’s expected $114 billion in data center revenue in its current fiscal year. Intel Corp., which is in the midst of a troubled turnaround, is even further behind as weaker than expected orders for AI accelerators have led to sales that the company said won’t reach its target of $500 million for 2024.
Meanwhile, chipmakers Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. are gathering momentum in sales of custom-made semiconductors and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom forecast in December that the market for the AI components it designs will reach as much as $90 billion by fiscal 2027, sending its shares soaring and raising concerns that so-called ASIC chips could take share away from Nvidia.
However, it’s unlikely that those custom chips will hurt Nvidia much given Blackwell’s significant technological advancement, according to Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore.
“Competing directly with Nvidia on cluster level specifications will likely remain a challenge,” they wrote in December.
And then there are the chipmaker’s biggest customers, who are hustling to develop their own semiconductors to avoid Nvidia’s high prices. Amazon has begun shipping the second generation of Trainium, which it aims to string together in clusters of up to 100,000 chips. Alphabet’s Google began building an AI chip a decade ago, and the latest edition is expected to be widely available this year. Microsoft Corp. announced an accelerator called Maia and a central processing unit in late 2023.
Valuation
How much investors will pay for Nvidia’s stock comes down to its growth outlook. With customers set to spend more on hardware and competition still playing catch up, that view looks bright at the moment. The shares are priced at almost 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months, below the average over the past decade of 34 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Still, that valuation requires Nvidia’s profits to continue to boom at a time when growth is slowing and higher costs related to the development of Blackwell are expected to weigh on margins. Nvidia sales are projected to climb 112% in fiscal 2025, 53% in fiscal 2026 and 21% in fiscal 2027. Its gross margin is expected to dip as low as 73% in the current quarter, down from 75% in the previous period, Nvidia said in November. However, it anticipates margins rebounding when production ramps up.
For a company that’s growing as fast as Nvidia, it all adds up to a fair price, according to Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services.
“There’s still plenty of growth left for Nvidia in 2025 and there’s still reason to be interested in the stock,” Yuschak said. “Still, that number depends on bigger and bigger spending. If there are any signs of a slowdown in AI spending, the price investors are willing to pay for Nvidia shares will fall.”

The
iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC)
rose 0.6% Monday as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced at a
press conference
his resignation after nearly a decade in office, citing the need for new leadership amid political challenges.
Trudeau, who is in his third term as prime minister, said while answering questions after the speech in Ottawa it was time for a ""fresh start in parliament"" in order for the country to navigate ""complex"" times domestically and internationally.
He added the transition will consist of two parts—the pausing of parliament until late March and his ultimate resignation which, Trudeau believes, will ""decrease the level of polarization"" in politics.
Trudeau’s challenges to remain in power escalated in December when his long-time ally Chrystia Freeland suddenly resigned as Canada’s finance minister and deputy prime minister. Freeland and former central banker Mark Carney are among the potential successors considered.
Why Canada ETFs Have Lagged SPY, U.S. Equity
Comparing the largest Canada ETFs like EWC and the
JPMorgan BetaBuilders Canada ETF (BBCA)
to the largest U.S. equity ETF, the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
, the performance of U.S. stocks (13% annualized) is more than double that of Canadian stocks (5.8%) for the past decade.
Canadian stocks have historically lagged U.S. stocks due to several structural and economic factors:
Sector Concentration
The Canadian stock market is heavily weighted toward natural resources, such as energy and mining, and financials, which can limit growth potential compared to the more diverse and innovation-driven U.S. market. The U.S. market benefits significantly from technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary sectors, which have been among the highest-performing industries in recent decades.
Innovation and Growth
The U.S. market is home to many of the world’s largest and most innovative companies, particularly in the technology sector (e.g., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Amazon.com Inc.). Canada lacks a similar breadth of large-cap, high-growth companies, which has constrained overall market returns.
Smaller Market Size
The Canadian market is smaller and less liquid than the U.S. market, which can make it less attractive to global investors. Additionally, the smaller pool of domestic companies reduces diversification opportunities.
Currency Effects
The Canadian dollar’s relative weakness against the U.S. dollar over extended periods has further contributed to the underperformance of Canadian stocks for international investors.

Venture Capital
The U.S. leads globally in venture capital funding and fostering startups, particularly in sectors like technology and biotechnology. Canada’s venture capital ecosystem, while growing, is comparatively underdeveloped.
Global Influence
The U.S. market is seen as a global benchmark, attracting significant foreign investment. This status creates a virtuous cycle of liquidity and valuation growth not as pronounced in Canada.
While Canadian stocks have offered strong performance in specific sectors and periods, highlighted most recently by a respectable 14% gain for broad market Canada ETFs like EWC in 2024, these structural factors explain why they have generally trailed the U.S. market over the long term. SPY gained nearly 25% last year.

Lightspeed Venture Partners is leading the round, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private matters. The $60 billion valuation would include the money Anthropic plans to raise in the round, the people said.
The Wall Street Journal was first to report the new fundraise. Anthropic didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Anthropic is one of the many startups raising billions of dollars amid the hype over generative AI. Just three months ago, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion, nearly doubling its valuation to $157 billion. Last month, Elon Musk’s xAI said it had raised $6 billion in new capital, wrapping up a funding round that has been in the works for months and was said to value the artificial intelligence startup at more than $40 billion.
In November, Amazon.com Inc. announced that it was investing an additional $4 billion in Anthropic, boosting an existing stake in the firm. That sum, in convertible notes, started with a $1.3 billion infusion, with the remainder to follow at a time the companies didn’t specify.
Some of the rest of the $4 billion could come as part of new Anthropic fundraising, according to a person familiar with the matter, but Amazon doesn’t plan to invest additional money beyond that at this time. Amazon declined to comment.
Menlo Ventures, which previously backed Anthropic, expects to invest again in the startup, according to a person familiar with the firm’s plans.
Founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, Anthropic has become one of the ChatGPT maker’s closest rivals. Anthropic has gained traction selling AI software to businesses, including finance and healthcare firms.
Anthropic was recently on pace to generate around $875 million in annual revenue, according to one person familiar with the matter.

ETFs such as the $58.5 billion

are getting fresh makeovers now that high-flying tech stocks including Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are no longer considered pure
growth
by the indexes the funds track, according to CFRA Research.

wrote
. Those companies, along with Advanced Micro Devices Inc., now fall in both camps.
Dozens if not hundreds of exchange-traded fund and mutual fund issuers follow S&P indexes when selecting stocks for their funds, and the firm changes the indexes’ weightings—or rebalances—often to reflect changes in stock prices, growth rates and more.
BRK, JPM Growth Scores Boosted
As a result, investors will get a smaller slug of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft in their growth ETFs. They'll also get larger portions of financial firms since the rebalancing gives Berkshire Hathaway Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and others more of a growth blush while dialing back value characteristics.
The rebalancing is important to investors because it “changes the sector exposure of any ETFs linked to these indices, which impacts their future performance,” wrote Ullal, a member of etf.com’s editorial advisory board.

S&P Rebalance: Growth vs Value
S&P rebalances the growth and value indexes based upon a widening or narrowing of a stock’s growth-to-value ratio. While a company moving out of growth suggests a slowing stock appreciation—Apple has surged 9.4% over the past 30 days and IVW itself jumped 3%—S&P looks at a range of factors, Ullal said.
“Although megacap tech names like Apple and Microsoft retain characteristics of growth companies like price momentum, they must have also scored relatively high on some value characteristics such as sales to price ratios compared to other growth firms in the S&P 500 universe like Nvidia, Tesla or ServiceNow,” he wrote in an email.
With their weighting in the S&P 500 Growth Index trimmed, tech’s share of the S&P Value Index has more than doubled, to above 20%, from less than 10% last year, according to CFRA. The tech companies mentioned above have been assigned weightings that are now about evenly divided between growth—a company growing faster than the market average—and value, a stock whose price may not accurately capture the company’s true value relative to the rest of the market.

Wolfe Research suggested that
Meta Platforms Inc.
(NASDAQ:
META
) has the potential to generate a staggering $30-40 billion in revenue from its business messaging services, a prospect currently undervalued by the market.
What Happened
: Analysts at Wolfe Research anticipate a “modest near-term upside” that could positively influence Meta’s FY25/26 Other-FOA revenue predictions, according to a report by Investing.com.
At present, WhatsApp's business messaging contributes a mere $1.5 to $2 billion annually. However, Meta’s plan to integrate AI agents into small businesses for customer service could significantly increase this revenue.

Wolfe Research stated, “We think it offers Meta a $30 – $40B revenue TAM.” The firm also highlighted that Meta is uniquely positioned to tap into this market due to WhatsApp’s existing user base.
These estimates take into account automation adoption, the total addressable market for customer service, and the number of businesses already operating on WhatsApp. They forecast that as automation progresses to manage more complex inquiries, “business messaging could accelerate,” particularly in key markets such as India, Indonesia, and Brazil.
Wolfe Research also foresees a promising medium-term opportunity, projecting “a high-single-digit to low-double-digit billion-dollar incremental revenue opportunity” in the next few years. This expansion could strengthen Meta’s platform engagement, particularly among businesses that rely on WhatsApp for customer interactions.

Why It Matters
: This prediction comes at a time when

are under intense scrutiny, following serious allegations from former executive

.
In her memoir “Careless People” and a whistleblower complaint filed with the SEC, Wynn-Williams accused Meta and CEO

of taking extreme steps to penetrate the Chinese market while simultaneously engaging in controversial lobbying tactics in India.
These concerns arise at a crucial moment as Meta revises its policies in response to shifting political dynamics, while Zuckerberg positions the company as a key force in American tech diplomacy. Last Week President Donald Trump also indicated that Meta Platforms could invest up to $ 60 billion into the U.S. by the end of 2025.

The construction for the site, in the small Texas city of Abilene, will be completed by mid-2026 with capacity of 1.2 gigawatts of power, according to developer Crusoe, which is set to announce the next phase of development on Tuesday. Though the facility will be large enough to support hundreds of thousands of advanced AI chips, it’s unclear how many have been committed to the project.
The Stargate joint venture was unveiled by OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. at a White House event in January, with the goal of providing the physical infrastructure needed for more advanced AI models from the ChatGPT maker. OpenAI previously said Stargate will expand to as many as 10 sites around the country.
Oracle has already agreed to use the Abilene location’s full build for Stargate, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private information. OpenAI currently has plans to use roughly 1 gigawatt of capacity at the facility, one person said. Crusoe declined to comment on the site’s clients. OpenAI declined to comment. Oracle didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Stargate joins a race among leading tech companies to build up capacity of Nvidia’s latest chips. Elon Musk’s xAI recently inked a $5 billion deal with Dell Technologies Inc. for AI servers for a supercomputer in Memphis. Meta Platforms Inc. has said it planned to have computing power equal to 600,000 Nvidia H100s — a previous generation of the company’s data center semiconductors — by the end of 2024. And CoreWeave Inc., an AI-focused cloud provider, has more than 250,000 Nvidia graphics processing units across 32 data centers, it said in paperwork for an public offering earlier this month.
While Stargate was formally announced in January, the Abilene data center complex was in the works before that. “If you came here a year ago, this would be a field of mesquite trees and shrubs,” said Crusoe Chief Executive Officer Chase Lochmiller in an interview. “We broke ground in June of last year and have been on a very accelerated build pace.”
Story Continues
Currently, there are about 2,000 people working on construction for the project, with plans for that to increase to nearly 5,000 workers, Crusoe said. There will be eight data center buildings, each designed to hold as many as 50,000 Nvidia GB200 semiconductors, the company said.
The White House announcement gave the long in-the-works project “tremendous credibility,” said Michael McNamara, CEO of energy startup Lancium, which is also developing the site and first inked an agreement with local officials to build a data center campus in Abilene in 2021. There’s now a sense among “all stakeholders that these projects need to be built bigger and faster,” he said.

The iPhone maker has tumbled in recent sessions, extending its year-to-date underperformance amid a growing number of risks that are overshadowing its traditional high-quality characteristics.
While Apple offers steady earnings growth and sits on a mountain of cash, headwinds form a daunting list for would-be bulls: it is heavily exposed to tariff uncertainty and China, its artificial intelligence offerings have repeatedly fizzled, and its lucrative partnership with Google parent Alphabet Inc. is potentially at risk. It trades at a premium to megacap tech peers despite slower revenue growth, suggesting that the haven case is harder to make for Apple and other big-tech names.
“People like to park in Apple, but right now the stock is expensive, and not only is growth slow, but the catalysts for growth are absent,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It doesn’t seem like AI is doing much for it, the environment is very uncertain, and it is very at risk with tariffs and China. While it isn’t as controversial as Tesla, it seems like it is just treading water, and it has been a while since we’ve seen anything truly innovative from it.”
Shares have dropped 14% this year, and are coming off their biggest three-day decline since November 2022, a selloff that took the stock to its lowest close since September. The stock fell an additional 0.8% on Thursday.
The Nasdaq 100 Index is down 7% in 2025, and Apple is responsible for nearly a fifth of that decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The CBOE Apple VIX, which tracks a market estimate of future volatility for the stock, has risen 56% off a February low.
Recent volatility reflects rising geopolitical risk, especially with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trump recently doubled levies against China to 20%, a potentially significant development for Apple, which counts the country as both as a key manufacturing hub and a major market; it got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana calculates that Apple faces a 100-150 basis point dent on operating margin and a 1-2% hit on sales growth if the surcharge carries on the full fiscal year.
Story Continues
Investors are hoping Apple will get an exemption, as it did during Trump’s first term, and it recently announced domestic spending plans that were seen as a way to curry favor.
Avoiding tariffs might remove an overhang on the stock, but wouldn’t represent much of a catalyst otherwise at a time when investors are anxious to see more robust growth.
Revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.7% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.8% pace expected for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This is despite Apple trading at 28 times estimated earnings, well above its 10-year average, and a premium to every other Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla Inc.
“There’s so much uncertainty from tariffs, and doubts that it can grow enough to overcome both risks like that and the valuation hurdle,” said Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services. “It isn’t the stock I’ll worry about first, since its balance sheet is stable and there are other pricey stocks where the businesses aren’t as durable, but I do wrestle with it.”
Yuschak is not alone. Fewer than two-thirds of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, making Apple the least-loved Magnificent 7 stock outside Tesla.
Investors had been optimistic that the iPhone 16, the first to be compatible with AI features, would entice consumers to trade up for the latest model. However, demand has underwhelmed so far, and in the latest example of its struggles with the cutting-edge technology, it is indefinitely delaying the release of its AI-infused Siri digital assistant.
In a potential positive, however, Apple will use Alibaba’s technology to bring AI features to Apple products in China. Last week, Alibaba said its latest AI model had performance that is comparable to DeepSeek’s despite requiring a fraction of the data.
Ed Cofrancesco, chief executive officer of International Assets Advisory, noted that Apple had avoided the kind of heavy AI spending of other big tech companies that is coming under increased scrutiny.
“This isn’t your play if you’re looking for a stock that will triple, but if the economy cools, it’s likely to be a safe haven given the quality and stability of its earnings and balance sheet, and its decades of showing it can pivot in the face of changing conditions,” he said. “There are a lot of land mines in the road ahead, and Apple is better situated to navigate them than other names in tech.”

Fleet management startup Motive Technologies Inc. plans to more than double its India headcount, joining a rising number of artificial intelligence unicorns from Silicon Valley expanding in the South Asian country.
The San Francisco-based startup plans to hire more than 300 people for its AI, product and engineering teams at its Bangalore development center over the next two years, Chief Executive Officer Shoaib Makani said in an interview. Valued at $2.85 billion in a 2022 funding round, Motive’s tools help fleet operators manage their workers, vehicles and expenditures.
Motive is among upstarts that are following major tech corporations like Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. into India, betting on one of the world’s deepest AI engineering pools to speed up product cycles and accelerate innovation. The southern city of Bangalore in particular is emerging as a hot spot as the tech industry spends billions of dollars to add facilities and recruit AI workers in the world’s most populous country.
“The AI talent density in Bangalore rivals the Bay Area,” said Makani, a Google and Khosla Ventures alum. “If you aren’t in Bangalore, you are at a strategic disadvantage.”
Bangalore, India’s foremost tech hub, will house a third of Motive’s global R&D headcount. Motive, whose 120,000 customers include the likes of FedEx Corp. and Halliburton Co., currently has about 250 employees in the country.
AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030, bolstering growth across the planet, according to a recent study by market research firm IDC. However, a talent shortage threatens to slow down its adoption — one in two AI jobs in the US will be unfilled by 2027, and India will be a million people short of skilled AI talent by that year, according to a recent report from Bain & Co.
Unicorn Abbyy Software, which specializes in AI-powered document automation, last week opened an R&D center in Bangalore with about 65 positions, and plans to double that over the next year. The region’s talented workforce offers tremendous opportunities for startups, Ulf Persson, CEO of the Milpitas, California-based company, said in an announcement.
Story Continues
Palo Alto, California-based enterprise AI startup Glean Technologies Inc., valued at $4.6 billion, had about 100 engineers in its Bangalore development center last year, with plans to triple the headcount this year. Other unicorns like ElevenLabs and AlphaSense have also opened research centers in India.
Next week, Norwegian AI company Cognite AS, which builds AI solutions for the world’s largest energy corporations, will open a Bangalore facility with about 100 positions, including roles in AI and machine learning.

Republican Mayor Braces for Tariffs: ‘We Didn’t Budget for This’
The S&P 500 Index tumbled 2% shortly after the open Tuesday, wiping out its $3.4 trillion advance since Election Day, Nov. 5. An afternoon rebound briefly erased the damage, but a late bout of selling left the index at its lowest level since Nov. 4, the day before Trump was elected. Meanwhile, yields on 10-year Treasuries swung 11 basis points from trough to peak, the dollar slid and Bitcoin staged a rebound. Traders who had been expecting two Federal Reserve rate cuts this year are now pricing in three, with more than 50% odds the first will come in May.
The dizzying ride provided a preview of the difficulties facing investors, who now must figure out how to price American assets in what essentially amounts to a new world order created by Trump’s tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. To make matters more challenging, the levies arise as cracks are spreading in the US economy, consumer sentiment is cratering and inflation remains sticky.
“Buckle up because more volatility is coming,” Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said by phone. “Traders are selling first and asking questions later, even with today’s technically driven rebound. Stocks are long overdue for this pullback. The real question is has ‘buy the dip’ turned into ‘sell the rip’? That remains to be seen and we’re not out of the woods yet.”
After the regular session ended, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview on the Fox Business Network that Trump may announce a pathway for tariff relief on Mexican and Canadian goods as soon as Wednesday. The comments sparked a rally in after-hours trading, pushing futures tied to the S&P 500 off their lows.
Wild swings like this are nothing new for the stock market in times of deep stress. The S&P 500 posted two days of 11% rallies in the midst of the 2008 global financial crisis before plunging deeper into a bear market. When the US sovereign rating was downgraded in August 2011, the gauge rose at least 4% twice. And during the pandemic rout in March 2020, it clocked some of the biggest gains in history on the way to a bear market.
Story Continues
Still, the turbulence and precipitous decline from the S&P 500’s Feb. 19 high are a comeuppance for those on Wall Street who bet big on Donald Trump’s election win, trades that powered the equity market higher along with the dollar and Treasury yields. The bet that Trump wouldn’t do anything to disturb the stock market rally has, for now, been lost.
Volatility Is Here
Things could get even more dicey in the days ahead, as the first batch of economic data from February arrives, including a government hiring report on Friday. Those figures will cover the period when worries about entrenched inflation started to take hold. Meanwhile, Trump will address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night and could stoke further trade tensions.
“There’s no question in the next six months, we’re going to have a lot of volatility and volatility is creeping up quite considerably,” Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., said at an RBC Capital Markets conference. “This is going to be a rocky year in 2025 for the markets as we try to get reoriented.”
To be sure, Trump’s policies of tax cuts and deregulation could yet juice an economy that’s shown remarkable resilience in recent months. The market turnaround turnaround on Tuesday was largely driven by dip buying in the same names that have carried the market for years - Nvidia Corp. and Alphabet Inc. chief among them.
To Fink, the wild ride shouldn’t deter long-term investors from diving in.
“If there’s a big dip, good. Good time to buy,” he said. “You’re going to be happy that you’re basically long equities.”
To get there, though, investors may have to show uncommon fortitude, as Wall Street has turned decidedly risk off. Investors have been dumping winners from the two-year stock rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 50% from the start of 2023. Aside from Meta Platforms Inc., the Magnificent 7 group of mega-tech stocks has been battered.
Few past winners have taken more of a beating than Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. Its shares are down 45% from their late 2024 high after almost doubling in value between the election and mid-December on bets that Musk would benefit from his close association with Trump.
The selloff has been even more extreme in the speculative corners of the stock market. A basket of the most-shorted stocks is down 22% from its near-term high in January. An index of profitless technology companies slumped 6.3% on Monday, its worst day since December. Bitcoin has been in freefall, even after Trump once again talked up his plan for a strategic crypto reserve on Sunday.
Trouble Below
“The market is overvalued and traders are now waking up to the fact that tariffs are coming, and they don’t want to pay for companies that are trading at multiples of 30- to 40-times forward earnings,” said Max Wasserman, senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital.
Investors have been steadily building positions in sectors that are relatively shielded from economic weakness or trade tensions, such as health care, consumer staples and financials. Meanwhile, industries that have steep valuations, substantial exposure to the global supply chain or are reliant on a confident consumer have been struggling. The technology and consumer discretionary sectors are by far the worst performers in the S&P 500 this year and the only two in the red.
The S&P 500 has been underperfoming its global peers this year, with equity indexes in China, Europe, Canada and Mexico all racing ahead. This has coincided with a steep decline in investor sentiment. Equity positioning slid sharply in the week ended Feb. 28, falling back down to near neutral and wiping out the post-election bump, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte.
Meanwhile, data is showing an increasingly fragile US economy. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that American factory activity last month edged closer to stagnation as orders and employment contracted.
All together, market pros have been closely watching if stocks indeed wiped off all of their post-election gains, a move that some say could be key, as Trump tends to use the performance of equities as one of the scorecards of his own achievements.
The Election Day level is key to traders because if the S&P sinks below that, investors who are “currently long risk would very much expect and need some verbal support for markets from policymakers,” strategists at Bank of America led by Michael Hartnett told clients in a note in late February. Now it’s up to Trump to respond.

OpenAI’s biggest backer has voided leases in the US totaling “a couple of hundred megawatts” of capacity — the equivalent of roughly two data centers — canceling agreements with at least a couple of private operators, the US brokerage wrote Friday, citing “channel checks” or inquiries with supply chain providers. TD Cowen said its checks also suggest Microsoft has pulled back on converting so-called statements of qualifications, agreements that usually lead to formal leases.
Microsoft in a statement on Monday reiterated its spending target for the fiscal year ending June, but declined to comment on TD Cowen’s note.
Exactly why Microsoft may be pulling some leases is unclear. TD Cowen posited in a second report on Monday that OpenAI is shifting workloads from Microsoft to Oracle Corp. as part of a relatively new partnership. The tech giant is also among the largest owners and operators of data centers in its own right and is spending billions of dollars on its own capacity. TD Cowen separately suggested that Microsoft may be reallocating some of that in-house investment to the US from abroad.
“While we have yet to get the level of color via our channel checks that we would like into why this is occurring, our initial reaction is that this is tied to Microsoft potentially being in an oversupply position,” TD Cowen analysts Michael Elias, Cooper Belanger and Gregory Williams wrote.
Microsoft shares were little changed in premarket trading on Monday.
A potential lease pullback by Microsoft raises broader questions about whether the company — one of the frontrunners among Big Tech in AI — is growing cautious about the outlook for overall demand. The company has said it expects to spend $80 billion this fiscal year on AI data centers, and on a late January earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said Microsoft has to sustain spending to meet “exponentially more demand.”
“While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in the company’s statement. “Our plans to spend over $80 billion on infrastructure this FY remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand.”
Story Continues
European stocks tied to the energy sector dropped on the report, which may suggest Big Tech companies will need less power to run their data centers. Schneider Electric SE and Siemens Energy AG slid.
Critics have consistently pointed out a dearth of practical, real-world applications for AI, even as Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have pledged to spend billions on the data centers needed to train, develop and host AI services.
Wall Street stepped up its questions about the massive outlays after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek released a new open-source AI model that it claims rivals the abilities of US technology at a fraction of the cost.
All About DeepSeek and Its Lower-Cost AI Model: QuickTake
Microsoft executives have played down concerns about AI overcapacity. It’s spending more than it ever has in its history, outlays that mostly go to the chips and data centers required to fuel power-hungry AI services.
Rivals have also doubled down on their AI spending commitments. In recent weeks Amazon, Alphabet and Meta have pledged to spend $100 billion, $75 billion and up to $65 billion respectively on AI infrastructure. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said this week it would invest more than 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over the next three years as it seeks to become a leader in the field.
In Friday’s report, TD Cowen’s analysts wrote that their channel checks had unearthed a number of signs that Microsoft is gradually retreating. They learned that Microsoft had let more than a gigawatt of agreements on larger sites expire and walked away from “multiple” deals involving about 100 megawatts each. (Data center capacity is often stated in terms of the power they need to stay up and running.)
TD Cowen said Microsoft used facility and power delays as justification for the termination of leases. That was a tactic rivals such as Meta previously employed when curbing capital spending, the firm wrote.
“To me this all looks and sounds like business as usual,” Mizuho Securities analyst Jordan Klein said in a note. “A company this large and with $80 billion of annual spend has the right to move in and out of data center leases, many of which were never officially signed.”
Large cloud hyperscalers typically use a mixture of leased and owned data centers across many locations, Klein said, so investors should expect some degree of “tweaking” of plans.
Microsoft’s alliance with OpenAI may also be evolving in ways that mean the software giant won’t need the same kind of investments. In January, OpenAI and SoftBank Group Corp. announced a joint venture to spend at least $100 billion, and possibly $500 billion, on data centers and other AI infrastructure.
In January, Microsoft said it would alter its multiyear deal with OpenAI so the AI startup could use cloud-computing services from rival providers. Microsoft, which had been the company’s exclusive cloud provider, still has a right of first refusal when OpenAI seeks computing horsepower to train and run its AI models.

The Mag 7 look more like the “Lag 7” in 2025, as the
Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP)
has outperformed the traditional market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 index, as mega-cap tech stocks have been a performance drag.
The Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)—led the S&P 500 to two consecutive years of 20%+ returns but have mostly underperformed smallcap and midcap stocks this year.
Through Feb. 4, RSP was up 3% while the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
rose 2.7%, and the
Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS)
lagged both with a 2.3% gain.
The performance story was quite different in 2024, as MAGS rocketed 64%, SPY jumped 25%, and RSP gained less than 13%.
Collectively, the Mag 7 stocks make up 33% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization and contributed over 50% of the S&P 500's gains last year, with an average increase of 63% among them.
Combining for such outsized influence, it’s no surprise that the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 would lag an equal-weight ETF like RSP, as four of the Mag 7 stocks have negative returns thus far in 2025.
Behind the Numbers
RSP’s 2025 outperformance can be attributed to several key factors:
Diversification Benefits:
RSP assigns equal weight to each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500, reducing the concentration risk associated with larger companies. In contrast, the traditional S&P 500 is heavily influenced by a few mega-cap stocks, particularly in the technology sector. When these dominant companies underperform, the equal-weighted approach of RSP can lead to better returns.
Performance of Smaller Constituents:
In 2025, the smaller, mid-sized companies within the S&P 500 have demonstrated strong performance, contributing positively to RSP's returns. The equal-weighted structure allows these companies to have a more significant impact on the ETF's overall performance compared to their influence on the market-cap-weighted index.
Sector Rotation:
Market dynamics in 2025 have favored sectors, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, that are underrepresented in the market-cap-weighted S&P 500. RSP's equal weighting provides broader exposure across all sectors, allowing investors to benefit from gains in sectors that may have less representation in the traditional index.
DeepSeek Selloff:
The introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, significantly impacted the performance of several mega-cap technology companies. DeepSeek's AI Assistant, utilizing its V3 model, has demonstrated capabilities comparable to leading AI models but at a fraction of the development cost. On January 27, 2025, following DeepSeek's announcement, major technology stocks experienced declines, most notably the Mag 7 constituent, Nvidia, which fell 17% that day. Other Mag 7 stocks in the red for 2025 include Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.
Story Continues
The bottom line is RSP's equal-weighted strategy offers more balanced exposure across all S&P 500 constituents, enabling it to capitalize on the strong performance of smaller companies and diverse sectors, leading to its outperformance relative to the traditional S&P 500 Index in 2025.
As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results and investors should consider multiple factors, including their financial goals and risk tolerance, before buying shares of any ETF.

Advantest, which supplies testers to Nvidia Corp., dropped as much as 11%, heading for a two-day decline of 18%, the most since a market rout in August. Chip equipment maker Disco slid 9.5%, while SoftBank Group Corp. retreated 6.7%. The latter has erased its gains from last week, when it rallied on news the company plans to commit $19 billion to an investment plan for artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US.
Other chip-related firms including Lasertec Corp., Screen Holdings Co. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. all fell over 4% at one point. In the US, Nvidia lost almost $600 billion in market capitalization on investor concern about competition from DeepSeek, which is widely seen as a low-cost rival to the US’s OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc.
“The fact that the cost of AI is decreasing is a negative for AI-related stocks, and it’s an irreversible trend,” said Ryoutarou Sawada, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory. “The cost of semiconductors, which are involved in creating generative AI, will also fall, which is bad news for Japanese makers of chip equipment.”
The impact of DeepSeek “is going to force a pause in some commercial AI infrastructure plans” and “should cause a slowdown” in AI-related investment, Pelham Smithers, an analyst at UK firm Pelham Smithers Associates, wrote in a research note.
That’s delivering a blow to power generators, who had been expecting AI investment to fuel electricity demand from power-hungry data centers. Shares of Kyushu Electric Power Co., Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Kansai Electric Power Co. fell over 2% Tuesday.
“It’s only natural that selling will spread to the periphery of the AI sector, like power generation stocks,” said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., whose shares jumped last week on hopes of an AI-driven demand boost for its US gas turbine business, plunged 8.6% at one point, the most since August.
Shares of Furukawa Electric Co. and Fujikura Ltd., which manufacture cables for data centers, also declined over 8.5%. Fujikura, Furukawa Electric, Advantest, Mitsubishi Heavy and SoftBank were all among the worst performers on the Nikkei 225, which was down 0.6% as of 11:30 a.m. in Tokyo.
Story Continues
However, the DeepSeek-led rout may offer some long-term upsides for Japanese companies involved in making AI, if they take advantage of the Chinese model’s “cost-saving” technology to develop a similar Japanese-language model, Smithers said.

The stock’s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
“This certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn’t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.”
Oracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market’s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999. Shares edged 0.2% higher on Thursday.
The joint venture has a goal of growing to “at least” $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.
However, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic’s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed “a bit chaotic.”
In a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.
“This is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,” Ghriskey said. “It is good to be on Trump’s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.”

A Small, Growing Player
Compared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence — which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.
“This moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. “While there’s probably some hype around Trump’s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren’t exactly cheap anymore.”
While Oracle’s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.
Still, the stock’s rally on the venture news hasn’t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company’s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.
The stock’s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft’s multiple of 31.
Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock’s rally.
“It’s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.”
He added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.
“In terms of value for Oracle, it’s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.”

Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January, as of its last close, putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022.

Competitors and customers are stepping up efforts to take a bigger slice of the artificial intelligence chip market. The sector’s blistering revenue growth is slowing. The Biden White House is looking to limit the sale of Nvidia’s most-advanced chips abroad, although it’s unclear how President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration will handle that.
Sounds scary? None of these risks are deterring investors from betting that Nvidia’s rally could add hundreds of billions of dollars more in market value in 2025 as the deluge of spending on AI computing keeps gaining steam.
“I’m not concerned we’ve seen a peak in Nvidia,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management. “There’s more growth to be had, although we should also see more volatility. The AI revolution is going to be a long road with a lot of potholes.”
That turbulence has been on display recently, with Nvidia shares slumping after a presentation by Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang fell short of investors’ high expectations. The stock dropped for five-straight sessions, shedding 12% since hitting a record on Jan. 6, as of its Tuesday close. It rose 1.7% on Wednesday.
Investors say these kinds of swings come with the territory.
“Nvidia’s stock is always going to be way more volatile than the market,” said Joanne Feeney, portfolio manager and partner at Advisors Capital Management, which raised its price target on the shares earlier this week. “We see it as having multiple years of well-above average growth in earnings, and we do see that as explaining and sustaining the valuation.”
Nvidia shares are projected to rise about 30% over the coming year, according to the average of analyst price targets compiled by Bloomberg. That would give the chipmaker a market value of more than $4 trillion, potentially dwarfing its closest peers Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Its revenue is expected to hit $129 billion in its current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 30, up from $27 billion two years ago.
Story Continues
That said, there are plenty of potential hazards ahead. Here’s a look at the biggest issues Nvidia faces in the coming year:
AI Spending
Nvidia’s rally ultimately depends on demand for AI services. Nearly half its revenue comes from a handful of tech giants who are rushing to add computing capacity. Capital expenditures by Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to hit a combined $257 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $209 billion in 2024. Of course, those plans could change if the companies and their customers aren’t generating the big sales they expected from AI.
“At some point we’re going to need to see new applications drive revenue acceleration for other companies for this investment to continue,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson and one of only eight of 78 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy rating on the shares.
Outside of hardware makers like Nvidia, the most visible AI revenue growth is coming from the big web services providers like Amazon, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure. However, it’s still a relatively small amount compared with how much the companies are spending on developing the technology.
So far, few of the tech giants’ cloud computing customers are seeing significant revenue growth from AI. Salesforce.com Inc. shares have rallied on high expectations for new AI offerings, but the customer relationship management software company hasn’t seen much of a sales boost yet. Palantir Technologies Inc., which makes data analysis software, has said its AI services are driving revenue growth.
“It’s imperative that the hyperscaler customers start generating meaningful returns,” Luria said.
Competition
Nvidia has a virtual monopoly on AI accelerators and is attempting to stay ahead of the competition by speeding up the pace for rolling out new chip lines. Its latest, Blackwell, initially faced manufacturing challenges that slowed its release. But Huang said it’s in full production now and will begin shipping in the current quarter, adding that demand for Blackwell is “very strong” and expected to exceed supply for several quarters.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is probably Nvidia’s closest competitor. But its projected AI accelerator sales of more than $5 billion in 2024 are just a sliver of Nvidia’s expected $114 billion in data center revenue in its current fiscal year. Intel Corp., which is in the midst of a troubled turnaround, is even further behind as weaker than expected orders for AI accelerators have led to sales that the company said won’t reach its target of $500 million for 2024.
Meanwhile, chipmakers Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. are gathering momentum in sales of custom-made semiconductors and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom forecast in December that the market for the AI components it designs will reach as much as $90 billion by fiscal 2027, sending its shares soaring and raising concerns that so-called ASIC chips could take share away from Nvidia.
However, it’s unlikely that those custom chips will hurt Nvidia much given Blackwell’s significant technological advancement, according to Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore.
“Competing directly with Nvidia on cluster level specifications will likely remain a challenge,” they wrote in December.
And then there are the chipmaker’s biggest customers, who are hustling to develop their own semiconductors to avoid Nvidia’s high prices. Amazon has begun shipping the second generation of Trainium, which it aims to string together in clusters of up to 100,000 chips. Alphabet’s Google began building an AI chip a decade ago, and the latest edition is expected to be widely available this year. Microsoft Corp. announced an accelerator called Maia and a central processing unit in late 2023.
Valuation
How much investors will pay for Nvidia’s stock comes down to its growth outlook. With customers set to spend more on hardware and competition still playing catch up, that view looks bright at the moment. The shares are priced at almost 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months, below the average over the past decade of 34 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Still, that valuation requires Nvidia’s profits to continue to boom at a time when growth is slowing and higher costs related to the development of Blackwell are expected to weigh on margins. Nvidia sales are projected to climb 112% in fiscal 2025, 53% in fiscal 2026 and 21% in fiscal 2027. Its gross margin is expected to dip as low as 73% in the current quarter, down from 75% in the previous period, Nvidia said in November. However, it anticipates margins rebounding when production ramps up.
For a company that’s growing as fast as Nvidia, it all adds up to a fair price, according to Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services.
“There’s still plenty of growth left for Nvidia in 2025 and there’s still reason to be interested in the stock,” Yuschak said. “Still, that number depends on bigger and bigger spending. If there are any signs of a slowdown in AI spending, the price investors are willing to pay for Nvidia shares will fall.”

joins a growing list
of companies that are pulling back on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
Like others before it, the social media giant cited
a U.S. Supreme Court decision
in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.
Conservative activists
have gone after companies — both in the

DEI policies typically are intended as a counterweight to discriminatory practices. Critics argue that education, government and business programs which single out participants based on factors such as race,
gender
and sexual orientation are unfair and the same opportunities should be afforded to everyone.
Joel Kaplan,
Meta's
freshly appointed global policy chief,
told Fox News Digital on Friday
that the move will ensure that the company is “building teams with the most talented people” instead of making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics.
“This is ultimately about doing what’s best for our company and ensuring that we are serving everyone and building teams with the most talented people,” Kaplan told Fox News Digital. “This means evaluating people as individuals, and sourcing people from a range of candidate pools, but never making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics like race or gender.”
Here's a look at some of the other companies that have retreated from DEI:
McDonald's
Four years after launching a push for more diversity in its ranks,
McDonald’s
said earlier this month that it is ending some of its diversity practices, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision that
outlawed affirmative action
in college admissions.
McDonald’s said on Jan. 6 that it will retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also intends to end a program that encourages its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.
McDonald’s said it will also pause “external surveys.” The
burger giant
didn’t elaborate, but several other companies have suspended their participation in an annual survey by
the Human Rights Campaign
that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.
Walmart
The world’s largest retailer
confirmed in November
that it would not be renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, and that it would stop participating in the HRC's Corporate Equality Index.
Story Continues
Walmart also said it will better monitor its third-party marketplace to make sure items sold there do not include products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, including chest binders intended for transgender youth.
Additionally, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts and it won’t be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.
Ford
CEO Jim Farley sent a memo to the automaker's employees in August outlining changes to the company's DEI policies, including a decision to stop taking part in HRC's Corporate Equality Index.
Ford
, he wrote, had been looking at its policies for a year. The company doesn’t use hiring quotas or tie compensation to specific diversity goals but remained committed to “fostering a safe and inclusive workplace,” Farley said.

“We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,” the memo said.
Lowe's
In August,
Lowe's executive leadership
said the company began “reviewing” its programs following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling and decided to combine its employee resource groups into one umbrella organization. Previously, the company had “individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.”
The retailer also will no longer participate in the HRC index, and will stop sponsoring and participating in events, such as festivals and parades, that are outside of its business areas.
John Deere
The
farm equipment maker
said in July that it will no longer sponsor “social or cultural awareness” events, and that it would audit all training materials “to ensure the absence of socially-motivated messages” in compliance with federal and local laws.
Moline, Illinois-based John Deere added “the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.” But it noted that it would still continue to “track and advance” the diversity of the company.
Tractor Supply
The retailer
in June
said it was ending an array of corporate diversity and climate efforts, a move that came after weeks of online conservative backlash against the rural retailer.
Tractor Supply said it would be eliminating all of its DEI roles while retiring current DEI goals. The company added that it would “stop sponsoring non-business activities” such as Pride festivals or voting campaigns — and no longer submit data for the HRC index.

Despite Cost-Cutting Moves, Trump Plans to Remake DC in His Style
Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development, so he’s moving over another top executive to help: Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. In a new role, Rockwell will be in charge of the Siri virtual assistant, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the moves haven’t been announced.
Rockwell will report to software chief Craig Federighi, removing Siri completely from Giannandrea’s command. Apple announced the changes to employees on Thursday following Bloomberg News’ initial report.
The iPhone maker’s senior leaders — a group known as the Top 100 — just met at a secretive, annual offsite gathering to discuss the future of the company. Its AI efforts were a key talking point at the summit, Bloomberg has reported.
The moves underscore the plight facing Apple: Its AI technology is severely lagging industry rivals, and the company has shown little sign of catching up. The Apple Intelligence platform was late to arrive and largely a flop, despite being the main selling point for the iPhone 16.
Rockwell is currently the vice president in charge of the Vision Products Group, or VPG, the division that developed Apple’s headset. As part of the changes, he’ll be leaving that team, though the Vision Pro software groups will follow him to Federighi’s software engineering group. The hardware team will remain under John Ternus and report to Paul Meade, a hardware engineering executive who worked on the Vision Pro.
A spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the moves.
The need to rescue Siri is especially urgent. The company has struggled to release new features that were announced last June, including the ability to tap into a user’s data to fulfill queries. Despite the technology not being ready, Apple advertised the enhancements for months on TV in order to sell the iPhone 16. Following development snags, the company further delayed the features earlier this month.
Story Continues
The Apple manager who has led Siri until now told his team in a recent meeting that the delays were “ugly” and that staffers may be angry and embarrassed. The executive, Robby Walker, also said he was unsure when the features would actually arrive due to competing development priorities. Apple has publicly stated that the features will be ready sometime in the “coming year.”
Apple shares have declined 15% this year, part of a broader retreat for tech stocks. They fell less than 1% to $214.10 on Thursday in New York.
By tapping Rockwell, Apple is betting on an executive with proven technical experience. He has demonstrated the ability to ship new products and run an engineering organization with thousands of people. Rockwell has a knack for solving problems and often takes the role of evangelist for futuristic technologies.
Rockwell is known as the brains behind the Vision Pro, which is considered a technical marvel but not a commercial hit. Getting the headset to market required a number of technical breakthroughs, some of which leveraged forms of artificial intelligence. He is now moving away from the Vision Pro at a time when that unit is struggling to plot a future for the product.
Over the last decade, Rockwell has been one of the few Apple executives to take a major hardware device from “zero to one” — industry parlance for conceiving a new product and bringing it to market. He joined Apple’s hardware engineering group in 2015, and the company released the Vision Pro in February of last year.
Giannandrea has a different background. A former Google star, he was hired in 2018 to run Apple’s AI work. Giannandrea had been one of Alphabet Inc.’s most senior executives, overseeing the search and AI divisions. Rockwell, in contrast, doesn’t have prior experience as an AI leader or clout within the burgeoning machine-learning community.
Apple has set the stage for the change by increasingly referring internally to the Vision Pro and VPG initiatives as “AI products.” Rockwell’s experience with hardware also could help the company more deeply embed AI into its future devices. Already, the company is exploring the idea of AirPods with outward-facing cameras that could feed data to AI.
Siri — the AI division’s main consumer product — has had a number of bosses over the years. When Apple first launched the voice assistant in 2011, it was overseen by software executive Scott Forstall. It was then given to services chief Eddy Cue in 2012 and transferred to the current software head, Federighi, in 2017. Giannandrea took it over a year later. Now it will be led by Rockwell, with oversight returning again to Federighi.
Giannandrea will remain at the company, even with Rockwell taking over Siri. An abrupt departure would signal publicly that the AI efforts have been tumultuous — something Apple is reluctant to acknowledge. Giannandrea’s other responsibilities include oversight of research, testing and technologies related to AI. The company also has a team reporting to Giannandrea investigating robotics.
Federighi, Rockwell’s new manager, is the company’s senior vice president of software engineering. He oversees development of Apple’s iOS, iPadOS and macOS operating systems, as well as development tools. Along with Giannandrea, he was a key figure in the development of Apple Intelligence. Right now, he’s also orchestrating an extensive revamp of the company’s core software.
Siri had been plagued by engineering and quality problems long before Giannandrea arrived on the scene. Though he struggled to turn around that technology, he’s made headway in other areas. That includes luring top AI researchers to Apple, which hadn’t been known for such work in the past. He also unified the company’s AI work under one roof, pulling in related technologies from across Apple into a single division.
The AI management shift has been months in the making and predates Apple announcing the Siri delays. Last year, the company tapped Rockwell deputy Kim Vorrath to help advise the Siri team. She’s known for bringing order and execution to troubled development programs. In January, she was officially moved over to the AI group as a top lieutenant to Giannandrea to oversee AI program management. She is now moving to Federighi’s division.
In the past several days, Apple started moving over another senior manager from Rockwell’s team — Aimee Nugent — to the Siri group. Like Vorrath, she has a reputation for fixing challenging projects. The changes allowed two of Rockwell’s trusted executives to evaluate the organization before he became heavily involved.
Inside Apple, Rockwell hasn’t been shy about criticizing Siri, according to people familiar with the matter. For years, he has pitched senior vice presidents on ideas for overhauling the voice assistant to make it more personalized. He has also been advising the AI group in recent weeks. Even before the management changes, Giannandrea long considered Rockwell a potential successor.
When developing the Vision Pro, Rockwell believed that Siri could be a central way to control the $3,499 device. Now, it’s only a limited element, with the company primarily focusing on hand-and-eye control.
Rockwell has had more experience with the AI team in recent months as the company worked to bring Apple Intelligence to the Vision Pro. The features are launching on the headset in April as part of a visionOS software upgrade.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said that concerns caused by Chinese startup DeekSeek’s R1 AI model — that fewer chips and powerful servers would be needed for such software in the future — were misplaced.
“The understanding of R1 was completely wrong,” Huang said at a meeting with analysts and investors at his company’s GTC conference Wednesday in San Jose, California. “Computation demand is much higher.”
Shares of Nvidia rose as much as 2.4% in New York trading. They had been down 14% this year heading into the session.
The company is trying to persuade a wider group of industries to invest in AI equipment, promising that the economic benefits of the technology are at hand. Nvidia, which became the world’s most valuable chipmaker after a dizzying growth run over the last two years, is facing more investor scrutiny in 2025. The key concern is whether customers will maintain their spending on AI infrastructure.
DeepSeek stoked those fears earlier this year when it released its AI model, saying it produced the powerful technology for less money. But Nvidia’s largest customers have reaffirmed their spending plans since then. And analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence this week found that expenditures by the biggest data center operators is actually climbing faster than anticipated.
At the analyst meeting, Nvidia’s Huang was asked about the efforts of customers to develop their own components — chips that might replace his AI accelerators in data centers. Companies like Alphabet Inc.’s Google have been working with Broadcom Inc. to develop their own application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, for this area. But Huang countered that many ASICs are designed but not always actually put into data centers.
Those big customers need better chips to generate more revenue from their infrastructure, not cheaper ones to save costs, he argued.
“All of those companies are run by great CEOs who are really good at math,” he said. “The effects are not just cost. It’s a different calculus.”

Competitors’ chips can’t match Nvidia’s Hopper design, its previous generation, he said. And the current Blackwell platform is 40 times more powerful.
To underscore that spending is still growing, Huang showed numbers that indicate he received far more orders for Blackwell than for Hopper-based products at the same point in their life cycles. And that’s just from cloud providers. Spending by other corporations on AI data centers will begin to supplement that, he said.
If the US economy slips into recession, Huang believes that companies will shift more of their investments toward AI gear — because that’s where the growth in their business is.
Proposed tariffs on imports, meanwhile, will have a small impact in the short term, he said. They won’t take a major toll on Nvidia because it will continue to shift manufacturing for the most important parts of its product line onshore. The chipmaker is already using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s facility in Arizona and will increase that as its supplier builds more capacity, Huang said.

That hasn’t been borne out this time around.

The iPhone maker has tumbled in recent sessions, extending its year-to-date underperformance amid a growing number of risks that are overshadowing its traditional high-quality characteristics.
While Apple offers steady earnings growth and sits on a mountain of cash, headwinds form a daunting list for would-be bulls: it is heavily exposed to tariff uncertainty and China, its artificial intelligence offerings have repeatedly fizzled, and its lucrative partnership with Google parent Alphabet Inc. is potentially at risk. It trades at a premium to megacap tech peers despite slower revenue growth, suggesting that the haven case is harder to make for Apple and other big-tech names.
“People like to park in Apple, but right now the stock is expensive, and not only is growth slow, but the catalysts for growth are absent,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It doesn’t seem like AI is doing much for it, the environment is very uncertain, and it is very at risk with tariffs and China. While it isn’t as controversial as Tesla, it seems like it is just treading water, and it has been a while since we’ve seen anything truly innovative from it.”
Shares have dropped 14% this year, and are coming off their biggest three-day decline since November 2022, a selloff that took the stock to its lowest close since September. The stock fell an additional 0.8% on Thursday.
The Nasdaq 100 Index is down 7% in 2025, and Apple is responsible for nearly a fifth of that decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The CBOE Apple VIX, which tracks a market estimate of future volatility for the stock, has risen 56% off a February low.
Recent volatility reflects rising geopolitical risk, especially with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trump recently doubled levies against China to 20%, a potentially significant development for Apple, which counts the country as both as a key manufacturing hub and a major market; it got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana calculates that Apple faces a 100-150 basis point dent on operating margin and a 1-2% hit on sales growth if the surcharge carries on the full fiscal year.
Story Continues
Investors are hoping Apple will get an exemption, as it did during Trump’s first term, and it recently announced domestic spending plans that were seen as a way to curry favor.
Avoiding tariffs might remove an overhang on the stock, but wouldn’t represent much of a catalyst otherwise at a time when investors are anxious to see more robust growth.
Revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.7% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.8% pace expected for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This is despite Apple trading at 28 times estimated earnings, well above its 10-year average, and a premium to every other Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla Inc.
“There’s so much uncertainty from tariffs, and doubts that it can grow enough to overcome both risks like that and the valuation hurdle,” said Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services. “It isn’t the stock I’ll worry about first, since its balance sheet is stable and there are other pricey stocks where the businesses aren’t as durable, but I do wrestle with it.”
Yuschak is not alone. Fewer than two-thirds of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, making Apple the least-loved Magnificent 7 stock outside Tesla.
Investors had been optimistic that the iPhone 16, the first to be compatible with AI features, would entice consumers to trade up for the latest model. However, demand has underwhelmed so far, and in the latest example of its struggles with the cutting-edge technology, it is indefinitely delaying the release of its AI-infused Siri digital assistant.
In a potential positive, however, Apple will use Alibaba’s technology to bring AI features to Apple products in China. Last week, Alibaba said its latest AI model had performance that is comparable to DeepSeek’s despite requiring a fraction of the data.
Ed Cofrancesco, chief executive officer of International Assets Advisory, noted that Apple had avoided the kind of heavy AI spending of other big tech companies that is coming under increased scrutiny.
“This isn’t your play if you’re looking for a stock that will triple, but if the economy cools, it’s likely to be a safe haven given the quality and stability of its earnings and balance sheet, and its decades of showing it can pivot in the face of changing conditions,” he said. “There are a lot of land mines in the road ahead, and Apple is better situated to navigate them than other names in tech.”

The retreat from Musk’s electric vehicle company, which has been the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 Index this year, has been so extreme that on Monday night President Donald Trump intervened, saying he would buy a new Tesla to support Musk.
On Tuesday, Trump chose a red Model S from the Teslas that were delivered to him at the White House. The stock rose in New York on Wednesday, putting it on track to extend gains as it attempts to stage a rebound following Monday’s 15% rout. But despite the presidential purchase — and the apparent opportunity to buy the dip — Musk’s faithful are nervous to wade in and scoop up shares on the cheap, fearing that the bloodbath may be far from over.

Advanced Chart
The stock was down 52% from the all-time high touched in mid-December as of Tuesday’s close and it has given back all of the gains it experienced after the election, back when traders were betting that Tesla would benefit from Musk’s close ties to the new president.
“This stock is trading on feelings right now and the downside pressure is winning; there is more room for the stock to fall in the next 30-60 days,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc., which oversees about $21 billion in assets. The shares “can easily go down to $200 or even below in the short term.”
Zacks held more than 270,000 Tesla shares as of Dec. 31. and Mulberry said he could see the stock getting back above $400 next year. But he is staying on the sidelines for now.
He isn’t alone. As the price fell under $230 this week, down from over $400 less than two months ago, Wall Street analysts — even some of those with a buy-recommendation — have been taking a more cautious stance. Just over the past week, at least four analysts lowered their price targets on Tesla, while two other long-term bullish analysts warned about poor sales and “negative” sentiment.
One of the few sources of support have been the retail traders who are among Musk’s most reliable fans. These small investors have, on net, purchased $2.8 billion of Tesla stock since last Tuesday, according to Emma Wu, a global quantitative and derivatives strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Story Continues
But even here, there have been signs of the pain. The author of one of the top posts on Tuesday on the Reddit forum for Tesla traders wrote: “I keep holding but at this point I’m beginning to doubt my decision.”
The problem confronting investors is that there are few events on the horizon that could improve sentiment
Updates on Tesla’s fully self-driving car or its robotaxi, are not expected any time soon. And Musk’s preoccupation with the Department of Government Efficiency has given rise to concerns that he is too distracted to run his car company.
The current Republican administration’s strong opposition to electric vehicles spells trouble for demand in US. And Tesla sales are also falling globally, with dire reports coming from China, Europe and Australia. In many places Musk’s growing involvement with global politics is seen as hurting the company’s brand.
The drops have been so drastic that several analysts have lowered their first-quarter delivery estimates, with UBS’s Joseph Spak on Monday warning that current profit expectations are looking too high. Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally cut his full-year estimate for vehicle deliveries to 1.75 million, from 1.88 million, in a report published Wednesday.
While these concerns have been weighing on Tesla shares since the beginning of this year, the stock really lost its bearing as the broader appetite for risk soured over the past couple weeks amid growing uncertainties about Donald Trump’s trade policies and fears of an economic slowdown.
“Tesla is now a proxy for the Trump trade and unless the market is willing to reward Trump and Musk for their efforts this stock will keep going down,” said Adam Sarhan, founder of 50 Park Investments. “There is no floor in this stock right now.”
The tables have turned rapidly on Tesla. After Trump was elected in November, Tesla shares quickly became the largest beneficiaries of that victory in the equity market. The stock jumped more than 90% in just over a month, despite the fact that the outlook for the company’s business continued to worsen.
Even after the retreat of the Trump wave, Tesla is still trading at a significantly higher multiple than other mega-cap peers. The shares were trading at 75 times forward earnings as of Monday’s close, compared to an average of 25 times for the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. The average S&P 500 member trades at around 20 times earnings.
The steep valuation and Tesla’s popularity among risk and momentum traders make the stock vulnerable to drastic selloff, but they also mean that any recovery, when it comes, can be swift and massive.
For now though, even the bulls are finding little to hold on to.
In the options markets, most of the flow is coming from investors looking for investors looking to protect against further losses, with puts trading at the highest level relative to bullish calls since the volatility shock in early August. One-month implied volatility on Monday reached the highest level since the end of 2022, when shares had slumped to near $100. Both skew and volatility bounced back a bit on Tuesday along with the stock.
“Tesla is in a freefall right now, which makes buying dips difficult for those with short-term time horizons,” said Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, and a long-term bull on the stock. “But those who try to be quick in selling here to buy back in a few days are playing a dangerous game.”

A family of models Microsoft is developing recently produced test results suggesting that they were competitive with state-of-the art rivals, including products from OpenAI and Anthropic, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter.
The Redmond, Washington-based company has tested how the models, called MAI, might perform on a variety of tasks, including powering elements of the company’s Copilot-branded AI assistants. Copilots are designed to handle a broad range of user questions, as well as provide specific suggestions for people working on documents or taking conference calls.
Microsoft is also developing so-called reasoning models, which are designed to field more complex queries and display human-like problem-solving, the person said. OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as Alphabet Inc., are also plugging away on such models. Microsoft last month incorporated OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model into its Copilot products.
“As we’ve said previously, we are using a mix of models, which includes continuing our deep partnership with OpenAI, along with models from Microsoft AI and open source models,” a Microsoft spokersperon said.
The Information reported on Microsoft’s models work earlier Friday.
Microsoft’s MAI models could eventually lessen the company’s reliance on OpenAI. Microsoft has backed the ChatGPT maker with some $13 billion, and the relationship between the two companies has been a subject of debate in tech industry circles. Microsoft and OpenAI recently renegotiated their deal, announcing in January that OpenAI could power its services with servers from other cloud-computing rivals, so long as Microsoft didn’t want the business itself. Their agreement runs until 2030.
OpenAI declined to comment.
“We’re both successful when each of us are successful,” Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said at a Morgan Stanley conference earlier this week. “So as you go through that process, I do think everybody’s planning for what happens for a decade, or two decades. And that’s important for both of us to do.”
Story Continues
The company already offers a set of smaller, Microsoft-built models, called Phi, and resells AI models made by a wide range of other companies. It has tested how models from companies including Anthropic, DeepSeek, Meta Platforms Inc. and Elon Musk’s xAI would fare backing up Copilot, the Information reported.
“We feel great about having leading models from OpenAI, we’re still incredibly proud of that,” Hood previously said. “But we also have other models, including ones we build, to make sure that there’s choice.”

Republican Mayor Braces for Tariffs: ‘We Didn’t Budget for This’
The S&P 500 Index tumbled 2% shortly after the open Tuesday, wiping out its $3.4 trillion advance since Election Day, Nov. 5. An afternoon rebound briefly erased the damage, but a late bout of selling left the index at its lowest level since Nov. 4, the day before Trump was elected. Meanwhile, yields on 10-year Treasuries swung 11 basis points from trough to peak, the dollar slid and Bitcoin staged a rebound. Traders who had been expecting two Federal Reserve rate cuts this year are now pricing in three, with more than 50% odds the first will come in May.
The dizzying ride provided a preview of the difficulties facing investors, who now must figure out how to price American assets in what essentially amounts to a new world order created by Trump’s tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. To make matters more challenging, the levies arise as cracks are spreading in the US economy, consumer sentiment is cratering and inflation remains sticky.
“Buckle up because more volatility is coming,” Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said by phone. “Traders are selling first and asking questions later, even with today’s technically driven rebound. Stocks are long overdue for this pullback. The real question is has ‘buy the dip’ turned into ‘sell the rip’? That remains to be seen and we’re not out of the woods yet.”
After the regular session ended, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview on the Fox Business Network that Trump may announce a pathway for tariff relief on Mexican and Canadian goods as soon as Wednesday. The comments sparked a rally in after-hours trading, pushing futures tied to the S&P 500 off their lows.
Wild swings like this are nothing new for the stock market in times of deep stress. The S&P 500 posted two days of 11% rallies in the midst of the 2008 global financial crisis before plunging deeper into a bear market. When the US sovereign rating was downgraded in August 2011, the gauge rose at least 4% twice. And during the pandemic rout in March 2020, it clocked some of the biggest gains in history on the way to a bear market.
Story Continues
Still, the turbulence and precipitous decline from the S&P 500’s Feb. 19 high are a comeuppance for those on Wall Street who bet big on Donald Trump’s election win, trades that powered the equity market higher along with the dollar and Treasury yields. The bet that Trump wouldn’t do anything to disturb the stock market rally has, for now, been lost.
Volatility Is Here
Things could get even more dicey in the days ahead, as the first batch of economic data from February arrives, including a government hiring report on Friday. Those figures will cover the period when worries about entrenched inflation started to take hold. Meanwhile, Trump will address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night and could stoke further trade tensions.
“There’s no question in the next six months, we’re going to have a lot of volatility and volatility is creeping up quite considerably,” Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., said at an RBC Capital Markets conference. “This is going to be a rocky year in 2025 for the markets as we try to get reoriented.”
To be sure, Trump’s policies of tax cuts and deregulation could yet juice an economy that’s shown remarkable resilience in recent months. The market turnaround turnaround on Tuesday was largely driven by dip buying in the same names that have carried the market for years - Nvidia Corp. and Alphabet Inc. chief among them.
To Fink, the wild ride shouldn’t deter long-term investors from diving in.
“If there’s a big dip, good. Good time to buy,” he said. “You’re going to be happy that you’re basically long equities.”
To get there, though, investors may have to show uncommon fortitude, as Wall Street has turned decidedly risk off. Investors have been dumping winners from the two-year stock rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 50% from the start of 2023. Aside from Meta Platforms Inc., the Magnificent 7 group of mega-tech stocks has been battered.
Few past winners have taken more of a beating than Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. Its shares are down 45% from their late 2024 high after almost doubling in value between the election and mid-December on bets that Musk would benefit from his close association with Trump.
The selloff has been even more extreme in the speculative corners of the stock market. A basket of the most-shorted stocks is down 22% from its near-term high in January. An index of profitless technology companies slumped 6.3% on Monday, its worst day since December. Bitcoin has been in freefall, even after Trump once again talked up his plan for a strategic crypto reserve on Sunday.
Trouble Below
“The market is overvalued and traders are now waking up to the fact that tariffs are coming, and they don’t want to pay for companies that are trading at multiples of 30- to 40-times forward earnings,” said Max Wasserman, senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital.
Investors have been steadily building positions in sectors that are relatively shielded from economic weakness or trade tensions, such as health care, consumer staples and financials. Meanwhile, industries that have steep valuations, substantial exposure to the global supply chain or are reliant on a confident consumer have been struggling. The technology and consumer discretionary sectors are by far the worst performers in the S&P 500 this year and the only two in the red.
The S&P 500 has been underperfoming its global peers this year, with equity indexes in China, Europe, Canada and Mexico all racing ahead. This has coincided with a steep decline in investor sentiment. Equity positioning slid sharply in the week ended Feb. 28, falling back down to near neutral and wiping out the post-election bump, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte.
Meanwhile, data is showing an increasingly fragile US economy. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that American factory activity last month edged closer to stagnation as orders and employment contracted.
All together, market pros have been closely watching if stocks indeed wiped off all of their post-election gains, a move that some say could be key, as Trump tends to use the performance of equities as one of the scorecards of his own achievements.
The Election Day level is key to traders because if the S&P sinks below that, investors who are “currently long risk would very much expect and need some verbal support for markets from policymakers,” strategists at Bank of America led by Michael Hartnett told clients in a note in late February. Now it’s up to Trump to respond.

The Shenzhen-based company, which got its start as a spinoff from Huawei Technologies Co., announced a new corporate strategy that centers on building a device-centric AI ecosystem at Mobile World Congress. The funds for its investment push will come from the company and its investors, an Honor representative said, without providing further details. Honor’s biggest backers are local government entities and it also has display maker BOE Technology Group Co. and two of China’s mobile carriers among its investors.
Newly appointed Chief Executive Officer James Li, flanked by representatives from partners Qualcomm Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, set out the company’s plan at the mobile industry’s biggest gathering in Barcelona on Sunday. Honor didn’t specify what it will spend the money on, apart from saying it’ll collaborate with global supply chain and carrier partners, like Orange and Telefonica, to co-create “a new paradigm for AI devices in the agentic AI era.”
Honor joins a rush toward AI across industries, which has been especially pronounced in China following the breakthrough debut of DeepSeek’s reasoning chatbot. The country’s major internet companies, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd., have accelerated updates to their AI models and started measuring themselves against the startup’s software. Honor aims to play a role in the contest for users by taking the device as its starting point.
The company’s approach is also distinctive for its close collaboration with US partners. Honor works with Google Cloud on the development of its AI agent and is integrating Google’s Gemini deeply into its phone software. At MWC, the company also introduced a Windows-powered AI PC in the MagicBook Pro 14, adding to its collaboration with Microsoft Corp.
Questions persist about the monetization potential of new AI technologies and chatbots, with several companies betting on the technology to primarily drive upgrades of hardware. Samsung Electronics Co. made a big push in that direction last year, alongside Apple Inc. with the launch of Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 16. Honor’s effort will have to measure up against those ventures as well as rising domestic competition in China.

The company advertised over the weekend for at least a half-dozen jobs focused on the frontier field of AGI or artificial general intelligence, from data experts and deep-learning researchers to a legal chief — even an intern for $70 a day. The roles are mainly located in Beijing though some will be based out of the startup’s home city of Hangzhou in eastern China.
The postings offer a glimpse into DeepSeek’s ambition to remain at the forefront of Chinese AI and compete with global rivals. AGI, which tech executives including OpenAI chief Sam Altman and SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son have portrayed as a sort of industry Holy Grail, refers to AI that understands, learns and applies knowledge across a range of tasks. Unlike more specialized models such as ChatGPT, AGI refers to general cognitive abilities similar to those of humans, sparking fears that AI could surpass human intelligence and run amok.
DeepSeek joins a coterie of players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google that have articulated plans to explore the field. Reclusive founder Liang Wenfeng has been quoted in interviews touting the field.
In ads posted over the weekend, DeepSeek sought a head of legal to help build a risk governance framework for AGI and lead communication with government agencies, regulators and research institutions. For the deep-learning research job, the Chinese company prefers applicants that’ve “achieved good results in industry competitions.” Even for prospective interns, candidates that have published papers for AI conferences or contributed to open-source projects will be prioritized, according to the postings.
The job ads joined existing positions advertised on popular recruitment site Boss Zhipin. Among the best-paid roles was that of AGI researcher, which could pull down 1.26 million yuan ($172,000) annually, according to the most recent ads.
The Chinese company previously posted ads for a chief financial officer, chief operations officer, head of administration and recruiting manager, suggesting the startup is embarking on a major expansion.
Story Continues
DeepSeek shook the AI world this year by releasing multiple models within weeks that showed impressive results when benchmarked against leading models from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic.
Its services have been overwhelmed with demand since late January, after it unveiled an artificial intelligence chatbot that it says can rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and was developed at a fraction of the cost.

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.,Equal - Weight RSP Outperforms S 500 as Mag 7 Falters,20250206T144500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equal-weight-rsp-outperforms-500-140000053.html,"Equal Weight ETF_Scale_Investing Concept
The Mag 7 look more like the “Lag 7” in 2025, as the
Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP)
has outperformed the traditional market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 index, as mega-cap tech stocks have been a performance drag.
The Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)—led the S&P 500 to two consecutive years of 20%+ returns but have mostly underperformed smallcap and midcap stocks this year.
Through Feb. 4, RSP was up 3% while the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
rose 2.7%, and the
Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS)
lagged both with a 2.3% gain.
The performance story was quite different in 2024, as MAGS rocketed 64%, SPY jumped 25%, and RSP gained less than 13%.
Collectively, the Mag 7 stocks make up 33% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization and contributed over 50% of the S&P 500's gains last year, with an average increase of 63% among them.
Combining for such outsized influence, it’s no surprise that the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 would lag an equal-weight ETF like RSP, as four of the Mag 7 stocks have negative returns thus far in 2025.
Behind the Numbers
RSP’s 2025 outperformance can be attributed to several key factors:
Diversification Benefits:
RSP assigns equal weight to each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500, reducing the concentration risk associated with larger companies. In contrast, the traditional S&P 500 is heavily influenced by a few mega-cap stocks, particularly in the technology sector. When these dominant companies underperform, the equal-weighted approach of RSP can lead to better returns.
Performance of Smaller Constituents:
In 2025, the smaller, mid-sized companies within the S&P 500 have demonstrated strong performance, contributing positively to RSP's returns. The equal-weighted structure allows these companies to have a more significant impact on the ETF's overall performance compared to their influence on the market-cap-weighted index.
Sector Rotation:
Market dynamics in 2025 have favored sectors, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, that are underrepresented in the market-cap-weighted S&P 500. RSP's equal weighting provides broader exposure across all sectors, allowing investors to benefit from gains in sectors that may have less representation in the traditional index.
DeepSeek Selloff:
The introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, significantly impacted the performance of several mega-cap technology companies. DeepSeek's AI Assistant, utilizing its V3 model, has demonstrated capabilities comparable to leading AI models but at a fraction of the development cost. On January 27, 2025, following DeepSeek's announcement, major technology stocks experienced declines, most notably the Mag 7 constituent, Nvidia, which fell 17% that day. Other Mag 7 stocks in the red for 2025 include Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.
Story Continues
The bottom line is RSP's equal-weighted strategy offers more balanced exposure across all S&P 500 constituents, enabling it to capitalize on the strong performance of smaller companies and diverse sectors, leading to its outperformance relative to the traditional S&P 500 Index in 2025.
As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results and investors should consider multiple factors, including their financial goals and risk tolerance, before buying shares of any ETF.

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.,Google rising holiday season ad sales arent enough to ease worries about AI letdown,20250206T093000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/googles-ad-sales-rose-robust-213556546.html,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google's digital ad sales continued to grow at a healthy clip during the holiday season, but that wasn't enough to offset investors' worries about whether its big bet on artificial intelligence will be lucrative as once envisioned.
The October-December results released Tuesday by Google parent Alphabet Inc. showed the company is continuing to reap even more profits from its dominant search engine and other peripheral services.
Alphabet earned $26.5 billion, or $2.15 per share, during last year’s final quarter, a 28% increase from the same time during the previous year. Revenue rose 12% from the previous year to $96.5 billion. The earnings eclipsed analyst forecasts of $2.13 per share, but the revenue fell slightly below projections, according to FactSet Research.
More importantly, revenue growth in the Google Cloud division tethered to the AI craze wasn't as robust as had been anticipated.
That letdown contributed to a more than 8% drop in Alphabet's stock price after the numbers came out. The downturn reversed a recent rally that had elevated Alphabet's shares to a new all-time high earlier Tuesday during the regular trading session.
“The reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue,” said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.
But the
AI-generated overviews
that Google has been increasingly displaying in at the top of its search results appeared to be helping to bring in more advertising. Google's ad sales climbed 11% from the previous year to $72.5 billion to exceed analyst estimates.
“The early signs suggest that AI is working for Google,” said Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, which helps websites rank higher in search results. ""What it does for Google is keep more of the digital experience happening within its search engine. And by the time they send someone to another site, shoppers and readers have already gotten further down their journey. So that visitor is worth a lot more to an advertiser.”
But Google also has spending billions of dollars on its AI expansion, a huge investment that some investors are questioning after t
he Chinese startup DeepSeek
found an effective way to deploy similar technology at a fraction of the cost. Alphabet is expecting its ongoing AI expansion to increase its capital from about $60 billion last year to $75 billion this year.
Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sought to reassure investors all that spending will pay off during a Tuesday conference call by emphasizing the way AI is helping to boost Google's fortunes by attracting more search traffic and making other services more popular.
Story Continues
“The company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing and launching products faster than ever before,” Pichai said.
Before the fourth-quarter results came out, Google made a change that
in its AI principles
signaling it may be more open to selling the technology in areas that it had previously indicated it would avoid. The revised principles removed previous commitments not to deploy AI in weaponry or surveillance that had been in place since 2018. Pichai didn't address the change during Tuesday's conference call and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The uncertainty over AI isn't the only worry hanging over Google.
The Mountain View, California, company also is facing a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., by far its most lucrative market, raising the specter that its revenue could be undercut.
After weighing the evidence presented during
a high-profile trial
, a federal judge last year
declared Google’s search engine is an illegal monopoly
— a decision that has opened the door for regulators to propose forcing the company to sell its Chrome web browser.
Court hearings on how Google should be punished for its abuses in the search market are scheduled to begin in April, with a decision anticipated before autumn.
Besides the legal assault on its search engine, Google also has been ordered
to tear down the barriers protecting its Play Store
for Android smartphone apps. That ruling is currently on hold while Google appeals. Google is also awaiting a ruling in antitrust trial in Virginia revolving around the technology underlying its digital ad network.

Deepwater Asset Management’s
Gene Munster
says
Meta Platform Inc.’s
(NASDAQ:
META
)
plans to invest up to $65 billion
this year to expand its AI infrastructure will benefit
Nvidia Corp.
(NASDAQ:
NVDA
) and other hardware players.
What Happened:
Meta CEO
Mark Zuckerberg
on Friday outlined the company’s capital spending plans for 2025 and its focus on artificial intelligence (AI).

Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target –

Zuckerberg expects Meta to allocate between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital spending, primarily aimed at expanding the company's AI teams and building a new data center. he described the new data center as being “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.” The tech mogul further noted that Meta aims to bring a gigawatt of computing power online by 2025 and is projected to finish the year with over 1.3 million graphics processing units.
Weighing in on the announcement, Munster said Meta’s commitment “exceeds Street estimates of $51B.”
""In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts,"" Zuckerberg said.

According to Munster, the increased investment in AI infrastructure will particularly benefit Nvidia and other hardware players in the short term. In the long term, the higher capital expenditure (Capex) is expected to accelerate the AI flywheel, leading to more innovation, lower usage costs, an increase in customers, and consequently, more investment.
He also issued a reminder, stating, “I believe the market is going higher and the run will end in a spectacular bubble burst.”
Why It Matters
: Zuckerberg’s announcement comes on the heels of Meta’s recent AI advancements. In December, Meta introduced the Llama 3.3 70B, a new AI model that outperforms competitors like
Alphabet Inc.
‘s (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) (NASDAQ:
GOOG
) Google,
OpenAI
, and
Amazon.com, Inc.
(NASDAQ:
AMZN
). This model offers the performance of Meta's largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, but at a reduced cost.
Story Continues
Last year in April, Meta announced its plan to purchase 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by 2024 to fuel its AI initiatives. Zuckerberg then said the 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs were initially intended to enhance Instagram Reels, not to position Meta as a leader in AI technology.
Meanwhile, President
Donald Trump
criticized the European Union (EU) for focusing on U.S. tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google. He accused EU regulators of unfairly targeting these companies, calling their actions “a form of taxation.”

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.,Oracle Takes Run at Cloud Big Three With Trump - Backed AI Pact,20250123T133000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-takes-run-cloud-big-105554582.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.

The stock’s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
“This certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn’t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.”
Oracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market’s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999. Shares edged 0.2% higher on Thursday.
The joint venture has a goal of growing to “at least” $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.
However, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic’s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed “a bit chaotic.”
In a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.
“This is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,” Ghriskey said. “It is good to be on Trump’s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.”

A Small, Growing Player
Compared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence — which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.
“This moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. “While there’s probably some hype around Trump’s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren’t exactly cheap anymore.”
While Oracle’s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.
Still, the stock’s rally on the venture news hasn’t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company’s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.
The stock’s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft’s multiple of 31.
Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock’s rally.
“It’s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.”
He added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.
“In terms of value for Oracle, it’s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Apple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January, as of its last close, putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two firms — Loop Capital and Jefferies — downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors.
Top Tech Stories
SK Hynix Inc.’s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025.
Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump’s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House.
President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down.
India is trying to pry open the doors of the world’s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country’s smartphones.
An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc.
Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.

Paytm’s sales slid for the fourth consecutive quarter as the Indian fintech pushes hard to emerge from the shadow of regulatory curbs a year ago that hurt much of its business.
Revenue fell 36% to 18.3 billion rupees ($211 million) in the third quarter through December, trailing the 19 billion rupees analysts estimated. Net loss narrowed to 2.08 billion rupees, Paytm said. Analysts, on average, expected 3.32 billion rupees in losses.
India’s banking regulator all but shut down Paytm’s banking affiliate early 2024 after years of warnings about unregulated data flows between that unit and the larger fintech. That clampdown disrupted Paytm, forcing founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma to forge deeper partnerships with other Indian lenders as part of its recovery effort.
Sharma has since sold Paytm’s movie and events ticketing business to Zomato Ltd., helping the company curb expenses. Paytm is also awaiting the Reserve Bank of India’s clearance to become a payments aggregator that’ll help online retailers and merchants on its network to accept customers’ digital payments.
Shares of Paytm advanced 1% in Mumbai trading, after falling as much as 3.1%. The stock plummeted sharply after the regulator’s action in early 2024, but has since recovered as investors bet its business will rebound. It’s still down 58% from its trading debut in 2021.
The company’s average monthly transacting users slipped to 70 million during the December quarter from 71 million in the previous three months. Paytm said it disbursed 38.3 billion rupees in merchant loans during the third quarter, 16% more than in the September quarter.
Sharma pioneered fintech in India with Paytm mobile wallets and QR codes that allow for easier digital payments. His backers included Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. founder Jack Ma, SoftBank Group Corp. boss Masayoshi Son and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman Warren Buffett, making Paytm India’s most valuable startup at one point.
Paytm competes with local and global players including Walmart Inc.’s PhonePe and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Pay in India’s hyper-competitive fintech space.

Competitors and customers are stepping up efforts to take a bigger slice of the artificial intelligence chip market. The sector’s blistering revenue growth is slowing. The Biden White House is looking to limit the sale of Nvidia’s most-advanced chips abroad, although it’s unclear how President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration will handle that.
Sounds scary? None of these risks are deterring investors from betting that Nvidia’s rally could add hundreds of billions of dollars more in market value in 2025 as the deluge of spending on AI computing keeps gaining steam.
“I’m not concerned we’ve seen a peak in Nvidia,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management. “There’s more growth to be had, although we should also see more volatility. The AI revolution is going to be a long road with a lot of potholes.”
That turbulence has been on display recently, with Nvidia shares slumping after a presentation by Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang fell short of investors’ high expectations. The stock dropped for five-straight sessions, shedding 12% since hitting a record on Jan. 6, as of its Tuesday close. It rose 1.7% on Wednesday.
Investors say these kinds of swings come with the territory.
“Nvidia’s stock is always going to be way more volatile than the market,” said Joanne Feeney, portfolio manager and partner at Advisors Capital Management, which raised its price target on the shares earlier this week. “We see it as having multiple years of well-above average growth in earnings, and we do see that as explaining and sustaining the valuation.”
Nvidia shares are projected to rise about 30% over the coming year, according to the average of analyst price targets compiled by Bloomberg. That would give the chipmaker a market value of more than $4 trillion, potentially dwarfing its closest peers Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Its revenue is expected to hit $129 billion in its current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 30, up from $27 billion two years ago.
Story Continues
That said, there are plenty of potential hazards ahead. Here’s a look at the biggest issues Nvidia faces in the coming year:
AI Spending
Nvidia’s rally ultimately depends on demand for AI services. Nearly half its revenue comes from a handful of tech giants who are rushing to add computing capacity. Capital expenditures by Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to hit a combined $257 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $209 billion in 2024. Of course, those plans could change if the companies and their customers aren’t generating the big sales they expected from AI.
“At some point we’re going to need to see new applications drive revenue acceleration for other companies for this investment to continue,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson and one of only eight of 78 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy rating on the shares.
Outside of hardware makers like Nvidia, the most visible AI revenue growth is coming from the big web services providers like Amazon, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure. However, it’s still a relatively small amount compared with how much the companies are spending on developing the technology.
So far, few of the tech giants’ cloud computing customers are seeing significant revenue growth from AI. Salesforce.com Inc. shares have rallied on high expectations for new AI offerings, but the customer relationship management software company hasn’t seen much of a sales boost yet. Palantir Technologies Inc., which makes data analysis software, has said its AI services are driving revenue growth.
“It’s imperative that the hyperscaler customers start generating meaningful returns,” Luria said.
Competition
Nvidia has a virtual monopoly on AI accelerators and is attempting to stay ahead of the competition by speeding up the pace for rolling out new chip lines. Its latest, Blackwell, initially faced manufacturing challenges that slowed its release. But Huang said it’s in full production now and will begin shipping in the current quarter, adding that demand for Blackwell is “very strong” and expected to exceed supply for several quarters.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is probably Nvidia’s closest competitor. But its projected AI accelerator sales of more than $5 billion in 2024 are just a sliver of Nvidia’s expected $114 billion in data center revenue in its current fiscal year. Intel Corp., which is in the midst of a troubled turnaround, is even further behind as weaker than expected orders for AI accelerators have led to sales that the company said won’t reach its target of $500 million for 2024.
Meanwhile, chipmakers Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. are gathering momentum in sales of custom-made semiconductors and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom forecast in December that the market for the AI components it designs will reach as much as $90 billion by fiscal 2027, sending its shares soaring and raising concerns that so-called ASIC chips could take share away from Nvidia.
However, it’s unlikely that those custom chips will hurt Nvidia much given Blackwell’s significant technological advancement, according to Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore.
“Competing directly with Nvidia on cluster level specifications will likely remain a challenge,” they wrote in December.
And then there are the chipmaker’s biggest customers, who are hustling to develop their own semiconductors to avoid Nvidia’s high prices. Amazon has begun shipping the second generation of Trainium, which it aims to string together in clusters of up to 100,000 chips. Alphabet’s Google began building an AI chip a decade ago, and the latest edition is expected to be widely available this year. Microsoft Corp. announced an accelerator called Maia and a central processing unit in late 2023.
Valuation
How much investors will pay for Nvidia’s stock comes down to its growth outlook. With customers set to spend more on hardware and competition still playing catch up, that view looks bright at the moment. The shares are priced at almost 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months, below the average over the past decade of 34 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Still, that valuation requires Nvidia’s profits to continue to boom at a time when growth is slowing and higher costs related to the development of Blackwell are expected to weigh on margins. Nvidia sales are projected to climb 112% in fiscal 2025, 53% in fiscal 2026 and 21% in fiscal 2027. Its gross margin is expected to dip as low as 73% in the current quarter, down from 75% in the previous period, Nvidia said in November. However, it anticipates margins rebounding when production ramps up.
For a company that’s growing as fast as Nvidia, it all adds up to a fair price, according to Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services.
“There’s still plenty of growth left for Nvidia in 2025 and there’s still reason to be interested in the stock,” Yuschak said. “Still, that number depends on bigger and bigger spending. If there are any signs of a slowdown in AI spending, the price investors are willing to pay for Nvidia shares will fall.”

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.,Google faces more scrutiny as united kingdom watchdog flexes new digital competition powers,20250114T133000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/googles-search-ad-business-faces-111953594.html,"LONDON (AP) — Britain's competition watchdog flexed new digital market powers on Monday for the first time with an investigation into Google's search and search ad businesses.
Under beefed-up rules that took effect this month designed to protect consumers and businesses from unfair practices by Big Tech companies, the Competition and Markets Authority said it would determine whether Google should be given “strategic market status” that would require imposing changes to the company's behavior. The investigation adds to global scrutiny that the U.S. tech giant is facing.
The Competition and Markets Authority said it will examine whether Google is using its position in the market to stifle innovation and block rivals. The regulator said it will look in particular at Google's role in shaping the development of new artificial services and interfaces such as “answer engines,"" in ways that “limit the competitive constraint they impose on Google Search.”
AI-powered chatbots have become increasingly popular with internet users looking for information online. Google last year
retooled its search engine
so that it now frequently favors responses crafted by artificial intelligence over website links.
Google said in a statement that it ""will continue to engage constructively with the CMA to ensure that new rules benefit all types of websites, and still allow people in the U.K. to benefit from helpful and cutting-edge services.”
AI's potential to transform online search services means fair competition is important, said Sarah Cardell, the U.K. regulator's chief executive.
“It’s our job to ensure people get the full benefit of choice and innovation in search services and get a fair deal — for example in how their data is collected and stored,” Cardell said in a statement. “And for businesses, whether you are a rival search engine, an advertiser or a news organisation, we want to ensure there is a level playing field for all businesses, large and small, to succeed.”
The CMA will also look into concerns about ""exploitative conduct"" by Google, including its practice of collecting vast amounts of consumer data without informed consent, and its use of content by website publishers — which could range from major media outlets to startups focusing on narrow subjects — without paying them fairly.
It will also investigate whether Google is giving preference to its own services, such as specialized search shopping or travel services.
The U.K. investigation is the latest salvo in an onslaught of regulatory pressure that Google is facing on both sides of the Atlantic.
Story Continues
In both
the U.S.
and
Canada
, authorities are targeting Google’s ad business with lawsuits accusing the company of anticompetitive or monopolistic conduct in the digital ad industry, which they want to resolve by breaking up the company.
European Union regulators, meanwhile, have been carrying out their own antitrust investigation and signaled that they would push for Google to sell off parts of its business in order to satisfy concerns about its lucrative digital ad business.
The CMA has until October to finish its investigation and said it could, for example, force Google to make changes to its data practices.
The regulator has said it expects to open three to four “strategic market status” investigations of the very largest tech companies in the first year after its new powers took effect.
Shares of Google's parent, Alphabet Inc., were essentially flat before the opening bell Tuesday.

The go-to chipmaker for Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. reported a 39% rise in October-December revenue to NT$868.5 billion ($26.3 billion), based on calculations off monthly disclosures. That compares with an average estimate of NT$854.7 billion.
The strong showing from Taiwan’s largest company bolsters expectations that big tech companies from Alphabet Inc. to Microsoft Corp. will continue to build and upgrade datacenters at a rapid clip to propel AI development. This month, AI server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. reported better-than-expected sales, while Microsoft outlined plans to spend $80 billion this fiscal year on datacenters.
Growth accelerated for TSMC in December, capping 34% revenue growth for 2024. That compares with TSMC’s official target of a 30% annual rise, though that outlook was expressed in US dollar terms. The world’s largest maker of advanced chips has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of a global race to develop artificial intelligence.
TSMC’s market value nearly doubled in 2024, and it now trades in the US at a valuation close to $1.1 trillion. Yet some investors worry about when the AI boom will peter out. While TSMC’s revenue beat, it was just 1.6% higher than the average projection and fell short of the most bullish analyst expectations.
More bearish market observers point to potential over-building, bottlenecks to development such as power shortages, and the persistent absence of a killer AI app or service that will use up all that server capacity. Investors will want to hear TSMC’s outlook for the wider industry when it gives its full earnings report on Jan. 16.
US-listed shares of TSMC were down 1.3% on Friday, tracking a broader pullback in markets — and folllowing news earlier this week on Nvidia facing new chip-export restrictions by the US government.
Beyond Nvidia and the AI arena, the Taiwanese company must grapple with mounting tech market and geopolitical uncertainties in 2025. TSMC remains reliant on Apple’s business, as the main producer of chips for the iPhone. The US company is struggling to galvanize demand for its marquee product in 2025, though many users hope that the gradual addition of AI features will drive the gadget’s next iteration.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
The company’s gross margin is likely to expand to a two-year high of 58%, or more. On the upcoming earnings call, four areas merit attention: First, the outlook for CoWoS advanced-packaging capacity build and revenue, which is likely to give insight into the expected strength for AI chip demand in the coming 12-18 months. Second, progress on the US Arizona fab’s ramp-up, which is critical to meeting the onshoring chipmaking needs of Apple, Nvidia and others. Third, potential margin pressure from weaker demand in 7-, 16-nm and larger mature nodes.
Finally, capital-spending plans for 2025, which will signal TSMC’s confidence in the uptake of its next-generation N2 node.

The US has also erected a web of restrictions to curtail the flow of Nvidia’s most powerful chips to China, with uncertain longer-term ramifications for TSMC’s key customer.
Morgan Stanley expects TSMC to project annual sales growth of low-20% in dollar terms. “TSMC usually guides conservatively at the beginning of the year, and then over-delivers,” analyst Charlie Chan wrote. The company raised its outlook for growth over the course of 2024 and may again be starting from a more conservative position at the start of a new year.
Longer-term, TSMC is pursuing a rapid international expansion. It foresees capital expenditure rising in 2025 from roughly $30 billion over the past year. It’s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That’s on top of construction underway in Japan, Arizona and Germany.

“If you kind of said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side. If you said 30, it’s probably on the late side,” Huang said in a question-and-answer session during Nvidia’s analyst day. “If you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.”
Shares in Quantum Computing Inc., D-Wave Quantum Inc. and Rigetti Computing Inc. dropped more than 30%, while IonQ fell about 29%. These stocks have soared in recent months amid excitement about the technology’s potential, which was heightened last month following a quantum computing breakthrough by Alphabet Inc.
Quantum Computing shares had gained more than 1,800% over the past 12 months to $17.49 through Tuesday’s close. Rigetti rose more than 1,500% to $18.39 over the same span, while D-Wave advanced nearly 1,000% to $9.55 and IonQ more than 300% to $49.59.
Huang’s comments also hit China-listed quantum computing companies, with shares in QuantumCTek Co. Ltd and Accelink Technologies Co. Ltd down sharply on Wednesday.
Shares in Alphabet, which had rallied 12% in December for their best month since May 2023, slipped 0.81%.

Hon Hai, also the world’s largest maker of Apple Inc. iPhones, reported NT$2.13 trillion ($64.6 billion) of revenue for the past three months. December revenue rose 42%, helping the company known as Foxconn beat analyst expectations. It also forecast “significant” sales growth for the first quarter, helping its shares rise as much as 3.6% in Taipei, their biggest intraday gain in about two weeks.
The company and other Taiwan AI hardware suppliers have enjoyed a boost from massive spending on servers for data centers by the biggest US tech firms like Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. But the lack of a compelling use case for AI so far has been making investors nervous about when the expansion might slow.
Goldman Sachs analysts revised up their 2024 earnings estimate by 1% based on higher-than-expected December revenue. They also raised revenue estimates for this year and the following two years, citing higher AI server revenue.
“The sequential revenue growth in Cloud supports our positive view on the next generation rack-level AI servers shipment ramp-up, and general servers and networking equipment demand recovery,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.
Hon Hai expects revenue from its cloud business, which includes AI servers, to match sales from its iPhone-making division in 2025.
Still, Citi analyst Carrie Liu warned in a note that the stock could experience near-term drag based on a first-quarter outlook from the company that seemed less than market estimates.
The AI market is important for Hon Hai’s effort to diversify its business away from Apple, whose iPhones are seeing muted growth. Apple has historically accounted for over half of the Taiwanese company’s sales.
Hon Hai also aims to break into the electric vehicle market, though that venture has yet to have any meaningful effect on its earnings. The company reached out to Renault SA about a tie-up with Nissan Motor Co., which Renault owns 36% of. For now, that pursuit is on hold as Nissan and Honda Motor Co. negotiate a merger, Bloomberg News reported.

Microsoft Corporation
(NASDAQ:

reduce its dependence
on
ChatGPT
-maker
OpenAI
.
What Happened:
Microsoft has been working on integrating internal and third-party artificial intelligence models into its AI product,
Microsoft 365 Copilot
, reported Reuters, citing sources familiar with the effort.
This move is a strategic step to diversify from the current underlying technology of OpenAI and reduce costs.
The
Satya Nadella
-led company is also decreasing 365 Copilot’s dependence on OpenAI due to concerns about cost and speed for enterprise users, the report noted, citing the sources.

A Microsoft spokesperson was quoted in the report saying that OpenAI continues to be the company’s partner on frontier models. “We incorporate various models from OpenAI and Microsoft depending on the product and experience.”
OpenAI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.
Microsoft 365 Copilot is reportedly yet to prove its return on investment to enterprises. The tech giant has not shared specific sales data on the number of licenses sold.
Why It Matters:
This move mirrors those of other Microsoft business units which have altered the ways they use OpenAI models. For instance,

Previously it was reported that company insiders were concerned about Microsoft’s AI strategy being
heavily reliant on its partnership
with OpenAI.
In October, the two companies engaged in talks to decide how Microsoft's $14 billion investment in OpenAI would be converted into equity in the AI firm.
OpenAI plans to remove a clause that restricts Microsoft’s access to its most advanced AI models upon achieving artificial general intelligence, according to a report published in December.

TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",Tesla Retail Fans Buy the Stock at a Pace Never Seen Before,20250321T234500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-retail-fans-buy-stock-144151015.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s stock is in a freefall. Its sales are plunging around the world. Even its most avid Wall Street bulls are turning cautious. But one group is buying the electric-vehicle maker’s shares like never before: CEO Elon Musk’s fans.

The company has long had an ardent fan base of individual investors who hang on Musk’s every word on X, the social-media platform he owns. They analyze Tesla in great detail in online forums and largely function as a hype crew for the stock.
But their current level of enthusiasm is staggeringly high, even by recent historical standards. Individual investors have been net buyers of Tesla shares for 13 straight sessions through Thursday, pumping $8 billion into the stock, retail trading data from JPMorgan Chase’s global equity derivatives strategist Emma Wu shows. That’s the biggest inflow over any buying streak since 2015, which is as far back as the data goes.
What makes the retail buying notable is Tesla’s share price has sunk 17% over this time, wiping out more than $155 billion from its market value.
“I’ve missed several opportunities with TSLA in the past. Now that the stock has dropped significantly, could this be a good time to invest?,” wrote the author of a post on the Reddit forum for Tesla traders. Another said they were “very happy” to buy the stock at a $225-$230 range. The shares closed up 5.3% at $248.66 on Friday.
“Tesla made some rookie to mid-stage public market investors extremely wealthy, a lot of people became millionaires because of this stock,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research. “People don’t forget that. And they will come back to a stock again and again if they feel it has been beaten up.”
Tesla shares have been on a steep slide since mid-December when it touched an all-time high fueled by optimism from Donald Trump’s election victory. But that euphoria vanished, with the stock retreating more than 50% from its Dec. 17 record, making it the second-biggest decliner in the S&P 500 Index this year. The rout has been so brutal that on Thursday, Musk sought to reassure Tesla employees during an all-hands meeting, likely sparking the rebound in the shares on Friday.
The enthusiasm was palpable on X, formerly Twitter, where the stock was heavily mentioned, while on Stocktwits — another online forum for individual traders — Tesla topped the list of the website’s most active securities on Friday.
Story Continues
What’s become clear is what Wall Street thought would be a boon for the company — Musk’s prominent role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency — has instead become an albatross. His growing political presence and involvement with controversies in Europe have triggered a backlash against the company and its leader, with the cars increasingly seen as political symbols. Protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails at Tesla showrooms and vandalized charging stations.
Sales of Tesla cars have sunk in key European markets, such as France and Germany, as well as in China and Australia. Global numbers won’t be available until the company reports its first-quarter delivery figures early next month, but analysts across Wall Street have been aggressively cutting their estimates for sales and profits, citing the bleak data from around the globe.
On Thursday, Morgan Stanley analyst and longtime Tesla bull Adam Jonas lowered his price target on the stock and reduced his sales expectations for the company, citing growing competition, an aging vehicle lineup and a “buyers’ strike from negative brand sentiment.” However, he kept his buy-equivalent rating on the shares, saying the weak near-term expectations are “not particularly narrative changing” for a company whose future depends on robotics and artificial intelligence.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives on Friday lauded Musk’s efforts for “hand-holding” employees and investors at a key time, and said that if the CEO continued to lead on his vision, the stock will be on a growth path where 90% of its valuation will be led by autonomous-driving technology and robotics. This bullishness explains at least some of retail traders’ continuing enthusiasm for the shares.
“These kind of investors don’t care about valuations at all,” Colas said. “They just believe in the future of the company and Elon Musk’s abilities.”

TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",Leveraged Tesla ETFs Make Big Moves Amid Epic TSLA Stock Skid,20250321T101500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leveraged-etfs-big-moves-tsla-230000630.html,"Tesla stock
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
is on a historic losing streak, falling for eight consecutive weeks—the longest in the company's history. Could this week make it nine in a row?
While Tesla investors are licking their wounds, things are even worse for those holding leveraged Tesla ETFs.
Leveraged ETF Gains and Losses
Shares of Tesla have lost half their value since peaking in December 2024, but the
Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares (TSLL)
has plummeted 80% during the same time frame.
On the flip side, inverse Tesla ETFs have surged. The
Tradr 2X Short TSLA Daily ETF (TSLQ)
has nearly tripled since Tesla’s peak, benefiting from the stock’s downward trajectory.
TSLL and TSLQ are the largest and third-largest Tesla-related ETFs in the U.S., respectively, with $2.9 billion and $324 million in assets under management. But they are just two of the 17 Tesla-related ETFs in the U.S., which collectively hold $4.8 billion in AUM.
The Tesla ETF Landscape
Including TSLL, five Tesla-focused ETFs offer various levels of leverage on the stock. On the inverse side, there are four ETFs designed to short Tesla at different magnitudes.
Then, some ETFs employ
covered call
strategies on Tesla to generate income. The largest is the $840 million
YieldMax TSLA Option Income ETF (TSLY)
, which has declined around 55% since Tesla’s peak—slightly more than the stock itself.
Using Tesla options to generate income has become a popular strategy, with five such ETFs currently listed in the U.S.
One Tesla ETF taking a different approach is the
Simplify Volt TSLA Revolution ETF (TESL)
, which uses options to “manage downside risks.” However, that strategy hasn’t provided much protection lately—TESL is down 53% since Tesla’s peak, slightly worse than the stock itself.
The following are two smaller, but intriguing, Tesla ETFs.
Battleshares TSLA vs. F ETF (ELON)
: A pair trade that combines a 2x leveraged long position in Tesla with a 1x short position in
Ford Motor (F)
. The fund, which launched a month ago, is already down 63%.
STYKd 100% UBER & 100% TSLA ETF (ZIPP)
: This fund uses leverage to combine positions in both Tesla and
Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER)
. It launched earlier this month and is already down 19%.
The Bottom Line
Tesla’s ongoing decline has put immense pressure on leveraged long ETFs while providing a windfall for inverse ETFs.
With Tesla teetering on its ninth-straight week of losses, investors in these funds will be watching closely to see if the trend reverses—or if the selloff continues.

The Scary Thing About the Wildfire That Was Stopped
After central bankers held monetary policy steady, as expected, Powell was measured in his assessment of how the president’s actions might shape the economy, citing the potential for the impact of tariffs on inflation to be “transitory.” The jump in stocks, the biggest for any Fed day since July, follows a bruising four-week stretch in which the S&P 500 slid into a correction. Treasuries saw an abrupt reversal, with two-year yields sinking below 4%.
“Start making T-shirts: ‘Transitory: We are so back!’” said Christian Hoffmann at Thornburg Investment Management. “The market will read this as dovish at the margin, with the Fed not overtly concerned with the economy or inflation. Stocks and bonds rejoice.”
After an epic bout of cross-asset volatility, Powell threaded the needle. His calibrated tone on recession risk – stating it was “not high” – soothed nerves among stock investors. Meantime, the central bank’s move to trim growth assessments gave fuel to the bond rally, with traders and the Fed now aligned on the rate-cut outlook this year.
“Powell came in and gave a pretty dovish performance in the sense of, ‘We got this, we’re in a good place, we can afford to wait, we’ll see how it goes, we’re gonna get the job done’,” said Bill Dudley, the former president of the New York Fed, on Bloomberg Television. “He was pretty reassuring to people that this was all quite manageable.”
The Fed will also start shrinking its balance sheet at a slower pace starting in April, reducing the amount of bond holdings it lets roll off every month.
“The Fed indirectly cut rates today by taking action to reduce the pace of runoff of its Treasury holdings,” said Jamie Cox at Harris Financial Group. “This paves the way for the Fed to eliminate runoff by summer, and, with any luck, inflation data will be in place where reducing the Federal Funds rate will be the obvious choice.”
The S&P 500 rose 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 gained 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9%. Megacaps like Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. led market gains. Boeing Co. jumped after saying cash outflows are likely to be smaller than forecast this quarter.
Story Continues
The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined four basis points to 4.24%. The dollar pared its advance to 0.2%.
Stocks rallied despite changes to Fed forecasts that could be viewed as bearish for equities, among them a tamping down of growth expectations in 2025 and a higher estimate of inflation.
That’s because the correction in stocks already accounted for a significantly worse economic backdrop than existed when the Fed last met, according to Amanda Lynam at BlackRock.
“A lot of that was baked in,” Lynam said on Bloomberg Television. “We’ve had such a bruising few weeks in the equity market. Most forecasters have reflected lower growth and higher inflation, and that’s part of what’s driving us here.”
Heading into the Fed meeting, money managers pared risk en masse and now have scope to re-build their equity positions from the lows. The latest Bank of America Corp. survey showed investors cut holdings of US equities at the fastest pace on record in the grip of the tariff-spurred turmoil hitting world markets.
“They changed the language enough and the dots enough that a market, that was possibly looking for a hawkish Fed, felt the need to buy stocks and bonds,” said Peter Tchir of Academy Securities.
To Bret Kenwell at eToro, while many observers are focused on the word “transitory” from today’s Fed commentary — triggering flashbacks to 2021 when rampant inflation ultimately forced the Fed to aggressively raise rates — perhaps the word of the day should be “uncertainty.”
“Investors may be wondering why the Fed is forecasting two rate cuts in 2025 if they believe inflation will be higher this year than they did three months ago,” Kenwell said. “Despite Powell arguing that the economy is strong overall, the Fed reduced its GDP growth expectations for 2025 too, allowing them to leave rate-cut expectations unchanged for the time being.”
While stocks are rebounding from a clearly oversold condition, Kenwell says investors should keep an eye on bonds.
“If Treasury yields continue to move lower, we could see a further rally in dividend stocks, utilities and other yield-sensitive assets,” he noted. “Further, if tech can continue to rebound — even if it’s just a short-term bounce — it could fuel a larger overall rebound in US stocks given the disproportionately large decline we’ve seen in this group.”
To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, the market reaction was interesting in the face of the adjustments in the Summary of Economic Projections.
“The ‘bad news is good news’ reaction suggests that investors believe the SEP is less of a crystal ball than a reflection of the current level of uncertainty, with incrementally dovish leanings,” Hackett noted. “It is also an indication that the universal pessimism of the past month is waning, though a sustained recovery will require improved clarity on tariffs and growth.”
At Citigroup, Stuart Kaiser said the market reaction suggests those Fed updates were both largely expected and fully discounted by the recent selloff.
“We are surprised if that is the case, but can’t argue with the price action,” he said.
Kaiser also noted that the S&P 500 lost a bit of momentum into the close.
“That suggests the fundamental aspects of the event are less favorable absent positioning dynamics that pushed the market higher intraday,” Kaiser said. “However, today’s trading did offer further evidence that position de-risking is in the later innings and also that growth risks are persistent.”
Kaiser remains cautious on risk markets given growth, policy, budget and tariff risks — although risk/reward has mproved during the past week.

That hasn’t been borne out this time around.

The iPhone maker has tumbled in recent sessions, extending its year-to-date underperformance amid a growing number of risks that are overshadowing its traditional high-quality characteristics.
While Apple offers steady earnings growth and sits on a mountain of cash, headwinds form a daunting list for would-be bulls: it is heavily exposed to tariff uncertainty and China, its artificial intelligence offerings have repeatedly fizzled, and its lucrative partnership with Google parent Alphabet Inc. is potentially at risk. It trades at a premium to megacap tech peers despite slower revenue growth, suggesting that the haven case is harder to make for Apple and other big-tech names.
“People like to park in Apple, but right now the stock is expensive, and not only is growth slow, but the catalysts for growth are absent,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. “It doesn’t seem like AI is doing much for it, the environment is very uncertain, and it is very at risk with tariffs and China. While it isn’t as controversial as Tesla, it seems like it is just treading water, and it has been a while since we’ve seen anything truly innovative from it.”
Shares have dropped 14% this year, and are coming off their biggest three-day decline since November 2022, a selloff that took the stock to its lowest close since September. The stock fell an additional 0.8% on Thursday.
The Nasdaq 100 Index is down 7% in 2025, and Apple is responsible for nearly a fifth of that decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The CBOE Apple VIX, which tracks a market estimate of future volatility for the stock, has risen 56% off a February low.
Recent volatility reflects rising geopolitical risk, especially with respect to tariffs. President Donald Trump recently doubled levies against China to 20%, a potentially significant development for Apple, which counts the country as both as a key manufacturing hub and a major market; it got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana calculates that Apple faces a 100-150 basis point dent on operating margin and a 1-2% hit on sales growth if the surcharge carries on the full fiscal year.
Story Continues
Investors are hoping Apple will get an exemption, as it did during Trump’s first term, and it recently announced domestic spending plans that were seen as a way to curry favor.
Avoiding tariffs might remove an overhang on the stock, but wouldn’t represent much of a catalyst otherwise at a time when investors are anxious to see more robust growth.
Revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.7% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.8% pace expected for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This is despite Apple trading at 28 times estimated earnings, well above its 10-year average, and a premium to every other Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla Inc.
“There’s so much uncertainty from tariffs, and doubts that it can grow enough to overcome both risks like that and the valuation hurdle,” said Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services. “It isn’t the stock I’ll worry about first, since its balance sheet is stable and there are other pricey stocks where the businesses aren’t as durable, but I do wrestle with it.”
Yuschak is not alone. Fewer than two-thirds of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, making Apple the least-loved Magnificent 7 stock outside Tesla.
Investors had been optimistic that the iPhone 16, the first to be compatible with AI features, would entice consumers to trade up for the latest model. However, demand has underwhelmed so far, and in the latest example of its struggles with the cutting-edge technology, it is indefinitely delaying the release of its AI-infused Siri digital assistant.
In a potential positive, however, Apple will use Alibaba’s technology to bring AI features to Apple products in China. Last week, Alibaba said its latest AI model had performance that is comparable to DeepSeek’s despite requiring a fraction of the data.
Ed Cofrancesco, chief executive officer of International Assets Advisory, noted that Apple had avoided the kind of heavy AI spending of other big tech companies that is coming under increased scrutiny.
“This isn’t your play if you’re looking for a stock that will triple, but if the economy cools, it’s likely to be a safe haven given the quality and stability of its earnings and balance sheet, and its decades of showing it can pivot in the face of changing conditions,” he said. “There are a lot of land mines in the road ahead, and Apple is better situated to navigate them than other names in tech.”

The retreat from Musk’s electric vehicle company, which has been the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 Index this year, has been so extreme that on Monday night President Donald Trump intervened, saying he would buy a new Tesla to support Musk.
On Tuesday, Trump chose a red Model S from the Teslas that were delivered to him at the White House. The stock rose in New York on Wednesday, putting it on track to extend gains as it attempts to stage a rebound following Monday’s 15% rout. But despite the presidential purchase — and the apparent opportunity to buy the dip — Musk’s faithful are nervous to wade in and scoop up shares on the cheap, fearing that the bloodbath may be far from over.

Advanced Chart
The stock was down 52% from the all-time high touched in mid-December as of Tuesday’s close and it has given back all of the gains it experienced after the election, back when traders were betting that Tesla would benefit from Musk’s close ties to the new president.
“This stock is trading on feelings right now and the downside pressure is winning; there is more room for the stock to fall in the next 30-60 days,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc., which oversees about $21 billion in assets. The shares “can easily go down to $200 or even below in the short term.”
Zacks held more than 270,000 Tesla shares as of Dec. 31. and Mulberry said he could see the stock getting back above $400 next year. But he is staying on the sidelines for now.
He isn’t alone. As the price fell under $230 this week, down from over $400 less than two months ago, Wall Street analysts — even some of those with a buy-recommendation — have been taking a more cautious stance. Just over the past week, at least four analysts lowered their price targets on Tesla, while two other long-term bullish analysts warned about poor sales and “negative” sentiment.
One of the few sources of support have been the retail traders who are among Musk’s most reliable fans. These small investors have, on net, purchased $2.8 billion of Tesla stock since last Tuesday, according to Emma Wu, a global quantitative and derivatives strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Story Continues
But even here, there have been signs of the pain. The author of one of the top posts on Tuesday on the Reddit forum for Tesla traders wrote: “I keep holding but at this point I’m beginning to doubt my decision.”
The problem confronting investors is that there are few events on the horizon that could improve sentiment
Updates on Tesla’s fully self-driving car or its robotaxi, are not expected any time soon. And Musk’s preoccupation with the Department of Government Efficiency has given rise to concerns that he is too distracted to run his car company.
The current Republican administration’s strong opposition to electric vehicles spells trouble for demand in US. And Tesla sales are also falling globally, with dire reports coming from China, Europe and Australia. In many places Musk’s growing involvement with global politics is seen as hurting the company’s brand.
The drops have been so drastic that several analysts have lowered their first-quarter delivery estimates, with UBS’s Joseph Spak on Monday warning that current profit expectations are looking too high. Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally cut his full-year estimate for vehicle deliveries to 1.75 million, from 1.88 million, in a report published Wednesday.
While these concerns have been weighing on Tesla shares since the beginning of this year, the stock really lost its bearing as the broader appetite for risk soured over the past couple weeks amid growing uncertainties about Donald Trump’s trade policies and fears of an economic slowdown.
“Tesla is now a proxy for the Trump trade and unless the market is willing to reward Trump and Musk for their efforts this stock will keep going down,” said Adam Sarhan, founder of 50 Park Investments. “There is no floor in this stock right now.”
The tables have turned rapidly on Tesla. After Trump was elected in November, Tesla shares quickly became the largest beneficiaries of that victory in the equity market. The stock jumped more than 90% in just over a month, despite the fact that the outlook for the company’s business continued to worsen.
Even after the retreat of the Trump wave, Tesla is still trading at a significantly higher multiple than other mega-cap peers. The shares were trading at 75 times forward earnings as of Monday’s close, compared to an average of 25 times for the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. The average S&P 500 member trades at around 20 times earnings.
The steep valuation and Tesla’s popularity among risk and momentum traders make the stock vulnerable to drastic selloff, but they also mean that any recovery, when it comes, can be swift and massive.
For now though, even the bulls are finding little to hold on to.
In the options markets, most of the flow is coming from investors looking for investors looking to protect against further losses, with puts trading at the highest level relative to bullish calls since the volatility shock in early August. One-month implied volatility on Monday reached the highest level since the end of 2022, when shares had slumped to near $100. Both skew and volatility bounced back a bit on Tuesday along with the stock.
“Tesla is in a freefall right now, which makes buying dips difficult for those with short-term time horizons,” said Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, and a long-term bull on the stock. “But those who try to be quick in selling here to buy back in a few days are playing a dangerous game.”

As Elon Musk's political activities and
Tesla Inc.'s (TSLA)
sales slump drive the electric-vehicle maker's stock down nearly 30% year to date, a surprising trend has emerged: Investors are aggressively buying the dip through a leveraged Tesla ETF.
Despite a punishing 54% year-to-date loss for the
Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares (TSLL)
, the leveraged Tesla bull fund continues to attract billions in new funds, revealing traders likely believe that the company's current challenges are temporary rather than structural.
The exchange-traded fund has lost nearly half its value in just the past month, reflecting Tesla's 28.7% stock decline in the same period. Yet, investors can't seem to stop pouring money into it.
TSLL, which aims to deliver twice the daily performance of Tesla stock, has attracted $1.3 billion in inflows over the past month and $2 billion year to date, even as the ETF has suffered a crushing 47.1% monthly loss and nearly 54% decline year to date, according to etf.com data.
""We tend to see inflows with our 2x daily TSLA Bull (TSLL) when we get pullbacks in the stock like we are experiencing currently with Tesla,"" according to Ed Egilinsky, managing director at Direxion. ""Our Leveraged and Inverse ETFs are designed for short term/active trading, and some traders believe that TSLA will reverse higher.""
The continued inflows come as Tesla faces multiple headwinds. The company is dealing with slowing sales globally, with European deliveries falling 50% year over year in January, Politico
reported
. In Germany, Tesla's sales crashed by 60% while overall EV sales surged by more than 50%.
Short-Term Traders Seek Opportunity Amid Volatility
""Since TSLL had inflows and TSDD had outflows last week, the data indicate that some traders are trying to buy the dip,"" according to Aniket Ullal, senior vice president and head of ETF research and analytics at CFRA. ""They may believe TSLA is oversold.""
While TSLL attracts billions, the
GraniteShares 2x Short TSLA Daily ETF (TSDD)
, which bets against Tesla's stock, has seen $13.1 million in outflows over the past month despite posting strong gains of 69.2% in that period and 74.2% year to date.
""Investors are betting on a TSLL rebound after a sharp 30% decline in Tesla stock,"" said Noah Damsky, principal at Marina Wealth Advisors. ""Investors have been conditioned to bet on a bounce back in stock prices, especially mega-cap tech stocks, given how well the market has performed over the last 10+ years.""
Story Continues
The company faces increasing competition from electric vehicle makers in China and Europe, while CEO Elon Musk's political activity has alienated some customers and investors.
""There is currently a lot of volatility and downside pressure on Tesla stock with consumer spending weakening, uncertainty with tariffs, increasing competition with EV makers and a slowdown in their deliveries,"" Egilinsky explained. ""The polarizing figure of Musk himself and mixed investor sentiment surrounding his involvement with the current administration could also be impacting the stock.""
Despite these challenges, several market watchers see potential for recovery. CFRA's analysts believe Tesla's stock decline primarily reflects already-known sales challenges, Ullal said, and the company has less tariff exposure than competitors. They also anticipate that upcoming U.S. autonomous driving regulations could provide a positive catalyst for the stock.
The long-term outlook for Tesla extends beyond its current vehicle lineup. Damsky pointed to multiple future growth drivers, including ""battery storage, solar and robo-taxis/autonomous driving,"" noting that these ambitious projects keep many investors focused on future potential rather than present valuation concerns.

NYC’s Finances Are Sinking With Gauge Falling to 11-Year Low
US Tent Facility is Holding Migrant Families Longer Than Recommended
Republican Mayor Braces for Tariffs: ‘We Didn’t Budget for This’
The S&P 500 Index tumbled 2% shortly after the open Tuesday, wiping out its $3.4 trillion advance since Election Day, Nov. 5. An afternoon rebound briefly erased the damage, but a late bout of selling left the index at its lowest level since Nov. 4, the day before Trump was elected. Meanwhile, yields on 10-year Treasuries swung 11 basis points from trough to peak, the dollar slid and Bitcoin staged a rebound. Traders who had been expecting two Federal Reserve rate cuts this year are now pricing in three, with more than 50% odds the first will come in May.
The dizzying ride provided a preview of the difficulties facing investors, who now must figure out how to price American assets in what essentially amounts to a new world order created by Trump’s tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. To make matters more challenging, the levies arise as cracks are spreading in the US economy, consumer sentiment is cratering and inflation remains sticky.
“Buckle up because more volatility is coming,” Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said by phone. “Traders are selling first and asking questions later, even with today’s technically driven rebound. Stocks are long overdue for this pullback. The real question is has ‘buy the dip’ turned into ‘sell the rip’? That remains to be seen and we’re not out of the woods yet.”
After the regular session ended, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview on the Fox Business Network that Trump may announce a pathway for tariff relief on Mexican and Canadian goods as soon as Wednesday. The comments sparked a rally in after-hours trading, pushing futures tied to the S&P 500 off their lows.
Wild swings like this are nothing new for the stock market in times of deep stress. The S&P 500 posted two days of 11% rallies in the midst of the 2008 global financial crisis before plunging deeper into a bear market. When the US sovereign rating was downgraded in August 2011, the gauge rose at least 4% twice. And during the pandemic rout in March 2020, it clocked some of the biggest gains in history on the way to a bear market.
Story Continues
Still, the turbulence and precipitous decline from the S&P 500’s Feb. 19 high are a comeuppance for those on Wall Street who bet big on Donald Trump’s election win, trades that powered the equity market higher along with the dollar and Treasury yields. The bet that Trump wouldn’t do anything to disturb the stock market rally has, for now, been lost.
Volatility Is Here
Things could get even more dicey in the days ahead, as the first batch of economic data from February arrives, including a government hiring report on Friday. Those figures will cover the period when worries about entrenched inflation started to take hold. Meanwhile, Trump will address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night and could stoke further trade tensions.
“There’s no question in the next six months, we’re going to have a lot of volatility and volatility is creeping up quite considerably,” Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., said at an RBC Capital Markets conference. “This is going to be a rocky year in 2025 for the markets as we try to get reoriented.”
To be sure, Trump’s policies of tax cuts and deregulation could yet juice an economy that’s shown remarkable resilience in recent months. The market turnaround turnaround on Tuesday was largely driven by dip buying in the same names that have carried the market for years - Nvidia Corp. and Alphabet Inc. chief among them.
To Fink, the wild ride shouldn’t deter long-term investors from diving in.
“If there’s a big dip, good. Good time to buy,” he said. “You’re going to be happy that you’re basically long equities.”
To get there, though, investors may have to show uncommon fortitude, as Wall Street has turned decidedly risk off. Investors have been dumping winners from the two-year stock rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 50% from the start of 2023. Aside from Meta Platforms Inc., the Magnificent 7 group of mega-tech stocks has been battered.
Few past winners have taken more of a beating than Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. Its shares are down 45% from their late 2024 high after almost doubling in value between the election and mid-December on bets that Musk would benefit from his close association with Trump.
The selloff has been even more extreme in the speculative corners of the stock market. A basket of the most-shorted stocks is down 22% from its near-term high in January. An index of profitless technology companies slumped 6.3% on Monday, its worst day since December. Bitcoin has been in freefall, even after Trump once again talked up his plan for a strategic crypto reserve on Sunday.
Trouble Below
“The market is overvalued and traders are now waking up to the fact that tariffs are coming, and they don’t want to pay for companies that are trading at multiples of 30- to 40-times forward earnings,” said Max Wasserman, senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital.
Investors have been steadily building positions in sectors that are relatively shielded from economic weakness or trade tensions, such as health care, consumer staples and financials. Meanwhile, industries that have steep valuations, substantial exposure to the global supply chain or are reliant on a confident consumer have been struggling. The technology and consumer discretionary sectors are by far the worst performers in the S&P 500 this year and the only two in the red.
The S&P 500 has been underperfoming its global peers this year, with equity indexes in China, Europe, Canada and Mexico all racing ahead. This has coincided with a steep decline in investor sentiment. Equity positioning slid sharply in the week ended Feb. 28, falling back down to near neutral and wiping out the post-election bump, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte.
Meanwhile, data is showing an increasingly fragile US economy. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that American factory activity last month edged closer to stagnation as orders and employment contracted.
All together, market pros have been closely watching if stocks indeed wiped off all of their post-election gains, a move that some say could be key, as Trump tends to use the performance of equities as one of the scorecards of his own achievements.
The Election Day level is key to traders because if the S&P sinks below that, investors who are “currently long risk would very much expect and need some verbal support for markets from policymakers,” strategists at Bank of America led by Michael Hartnett told clients in a note in late February. Now it’s up to Trump to respond.

Sales plunged 76% to 1,429 cars, according to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority. Tesla’s showing was in stark contrast with overall electric vehicle registrations, which jumped 31% in February.
Tesla shares pared gains in premarket trading Wednesday after the German authority released its figures. The stock was up 1.2% as of 7 a.m. in New York. It’s fallen 33% so far this year.
Musk endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany in the months leading up to the Feb. 23 election, throwing his weight behind an anti-immigrant, pro-Russian party that’s assailed the country’s political establishment. While the AfD vaulted into second place, the likely next Chancellor Friedrich Merz has vowed to keep the party at arm’s length.
Through the first two months of the year, Tesla’s sales are down 71% in Germany and 44% in France, the two biggest EV markets in the European Union.
In the UK — which surpassed Germany last year as the top EV market in the region — Tesla’s registrations are up 11% through the first two months after a big gain in February.
There are other factors at play besides Musk’s politicking that are holding Tesla back early this year.
The carmaker is suspending output at plants that make the Model Y — by far its most popular vehicle — to rework assembly lines. It will then take time for the company to ramp up production of the sport utility vehicle, which has undergone a facelift five years after its debut.
Tesla’s factory in Grünheide, outside Berlin, is among the facilities that will lose several weeks of production due to the changeover. The company also relies on a narrow lineup of vehicles that are coming up against stiffer competition, both from local incumbents and entrants from China. BYD Co. outsold Tesla in several European markets early this year.
Tesla also contended with attacks on railway infrastructure surrounding the company’s German plant last month. The activist group that’s claimed responsibility for the setting fire to equipment said online that it’s trying to prevent the company from expanding its factory.

Is the “Trump trade” fizzling out? - MarketWatch photo illustration/Getty Images, iStockphoto
That didn’t take long.
President Donald Trump has been back in the White House for less than a month. Yet many of the most popular “Trump trades” have already seen their momentum wane, while Chinese and European stocks — which had struggled in the aftermath of his electoral victory — are racing ahead.

‘We are shocked and upset’: My mother died and her second husband said he now owns everything. Is this true?
After surging through the first half of January, the U.S. dollar DXY has softened against both developed and emerging-market rivals over the past few weeks, as currency traders come around to the idea that Trump’s threats for universal tariffs might simply be the opening salvo in a negotiation to wring economic and political concessions from other nations.
“It’s definitely a negotiating tactic,” said Brian Mulberry, a portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, about Trump’s tariff plans.
In other instances, the shift could be a sign that the speculative fervor ignited by Trump’s decisive victory has started to cool. Cryptocurrencies, one of the most successful Trump trades, have mostly moved sideways since the inauguration. The price of bitcoin BTCUSD, the pioneering digital currency, has struggled to reclaim $100,000.
And popular “meme” tokens, like
Trump’s own crypto
TRUMPUSD and the infamous
fartcoin
, have fallen dramatically. On the campaign trail, Trump often spoke about plans to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. But so far, the administration hasn’t announced any plans to follow through.
Many U.S. stocks closely associated with the Trump trade have also struggled. Shares of Geo Group Inc. GEO, a private-prison company expected to benefit from mass deportations, have fallen about 25% since the inauguration. As of Friday, they were trading just shy of $27 a share.
Tesla Inc. TSLA, which appeared to benefit from Chief Executive Elon Musk’s close association with Trump, has slumped since the start of 2025, while shares of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. DJT have also turned lower recently.
But it isn’t just individual stocks: Broad U.S. stock indexes like the S&P 500 SPX have drifted aimlessly over the past three weeks. The index ultimately
finished lower Friday
after making a run at a fresh record high.
Story Continues
Three weeks without a new S&P 500 record high might not seem like a big deal. But there are signs that some investors are growing increasingly nervous.
The latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors, a widely followed gauge of overall market sentiment, found that more than 47% of respondents had turned downbeat on stocks. That was the highest bearish reading since late 2023.
Stocks’ loss of upward momentum might be making the retail crowd anxious, but so far, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, sees little reason for concern. Instead, he chalked it up to a classic “buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news” reaction.
“There’s a reason why the phrase ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ is popular,” Sosnick said. “Markets can frequently get exuberant about potential events, only to discover that the reality is less exciting than the anticipation.”
Chinese and European stocks race ahead
While U.S. stocks have dithered, Chinese and European shares have galloped ahead.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HK:HSI has gained nearly 13% since the start of 2025, while Europe’s Euro Stoxx 50 index XX:SX5E has gained more than 9%, tallying a record high on Thursday for the first time in 25 years. U.S.-traded shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant, have soared more than 45% since Jan. 1, according to FactSet data.
Jason Hsu, chief investment officer of Rayliant Global Advisors, said the artificial-intelligence app DeepSeek’s demonstration that China can actually innovate in the realm of AI technology has helped to revive the fortunes of its flagging stock market.
“DeepSeek foundationally changed the psychology of Chinese investors,” Hsu said. “Previously, they had been under the assumption that China was just in this chokehold laid down by the U.S. Now, people are thinking that China can compete — not just on manufacturing, but on the frontiers of software development.”
DeepSeek isn’t the only notable development to come out of China recently. Shares of BYD Co. Ltd. HK:1211 CN:002594 surged after the leading Chinese electric-vehicle maker unveiled its “God’s Eye” full self-driving technology, and said it would enable it on most of its vehicles for no extra cost. The dollar’s weakness and Trump’s less aggressive tack on tariffs have also helped boost Chinese stocks, and the Chinese yuan USDCNY as well.
When it comes to Trump trades like the dollar, navigating the path forward could prove particularly tricky. If Treasury yields continue to trend lower and Trump abstains from imposing sweeping tariffs, it is possible that the dollar could continue to ease.
But nobody can say for sure what Trump might be planning. For now, any sign that the president might make good on his trade threats would likely give the greenback at least a temporary boost.
“It’s like a roulette wheel,” said Ryan Dykmans, chief investment officer at Dunham & Associates Investment Counsel. “You really don’t know what’s going to happen next.”
If the past is any guide, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin might struggle to move meaningfully higher in the near term. Even after the latest pullback, bitcoin prices are still up by more than 40% since the election, FactSet data showed.
Others agreed that the near-term future for the U.S. stock market looks more promising. The fundamentals underpinning U.S. stocks remain intact, and the U.S. economy has continued to grow more quickly than that of the eurozone, while China has struggled with the aftermath of the historic collapse of its real-estate market.
The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite COMP and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA all finished the week higher despite a hotter-than-expected inflation report released Wednesday. So far, investors appear to be taking in stride the prospect that the Federal Reserve might leave interest rates on hold until later this year.
“I don’t think there’s any concern about the bull market petering out,” said Eric Schiffer, CEO of the Patriarch Organization.
Ultimately, whether this is just a “catch-up trade” or a larger shift in market leadership remains to be seen. For his part, Dykmans will be paying close attention to fundamentals like earnings growth, while Schiffer said he would continue to monitor corporate earnings calls for signs that management teams are growing more concerned. Lately, mentions of the word “recession” have been pretty rare, he noted.

An ETF managed by YouTube financial personality Kevin Paffrath is closing, in part, after Paffrath bet that interest rates would continue falling, and he says, after overextending himself with real estate and other projects.
The
Meet Kevin Pricing Power ETF (PP),
with $34.5 million in assets, will liquidate by Feb. 28, according to a
statement
from Tidal Financial Group, which issued the exchange-traded fund in November 2022 under its previous name Toroso.
The fund, started with $500,000, performed well initially thanks partly to Paffrath’s ability to reach more than two million YouTube subscribers, as well as bets on
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
In a
video
posted Feb. 11, Paffrath said assets soared to around $50 million.
After a September interest rate cut, Paffrath bet on falling interest rates. The
Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bull 3X Shares (TMF)
, a high-risk fund that aims to provide outsized returns on bets on U.S. Treasury Bonds, replaced tech companies as PP’s top holding with a nearly 16% allocation. Interest rates have climbed, crushing Paffrath’s bets.
PP’s price was unchanged over the past year, compared with a 22% gain in the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
.
Overextended YouTuber
The father of seven, whose
website
lists his real estate companies and educational courses along with photos of him with a Tesla Cybertruck and a private jet, said in a tweet that he had overextended himself.
“I took on too much,” he
wrote
on X, saying his priorities are his family, YouTube classes and his HouseHack business. “I made a mistake expanding into too much too quickly.”
He said he lost a personal investment of around $1 million due to fees, lawyers and other costs associated with running the fund.
Paffrath also cited interference from his partners without mentioning Tidal or other firms. He said the partners’ rules forbade him from doing things like boosting the size of his bets on Tesla, and they also didn’t execute trades as quickly as he would have wanted.

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) has expanded its energy-focused group of products with the unveiling of an energy storage and hydrogen ETF.
The asset management giant's iShares Energy Storage and Hydrogen UCITS ETF (STOR) is listed on Euronext Amsterdam with a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.50%.
STOR tracks the STOXX Global Energy Storage and Hydrogen index, offering exposure to the energy storage industry.
This includes companies involved in energy storage systems such as stationary and heavy-duty batteries, as well as hydrogen fuel and fuel cells, as alternative energy solutions. Its top three holdings are Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., which makes up 8.2% of its portfolio, Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (APD) and Asahi Kasei Corp., which compose 7.7% and 7% stakes, respectively.
This sector has grown as consumers and companies look for more efficient, cost-effective ways to generate power. Contemporary Amperex Technology is a Chinese battery manufacturer and tech company that produces lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage systems, among other purposes. It is a major supplier to Tesla Inc. (TSLA).
On Monday, the company and Jiangsu Lopal Tech Co., a Chinese chemical manufacturer that produces and sells lithium iron phosphate cathode materials, said that they were restarting their lithium refinery after a five-month delay. The move could keep prices for the key component in batteries depressed.
Air Products is a provider of so-called atmospheric gases, equipment and related services for companies in the U.S. and Asia.
Constituents are selected based on FactSet's Revere (RBICS) granular data to discern revenue sources of the eligible companies.
Additionally, EconSight's patent data is used to identify innovators in a set of technologies linked to the theme.
BlackRock to Debut a Spot Bitcoin ETF
BlackRock, which has more than $11 trillion in assets under management, is already poised to expand its ETF offerings. It is set to unveil a bitcoin ETP in Europe, with marketing likely to begin as early as this month.
The bitcoin fund follows less than 14 months after its debut of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. That product has generated nearly $41 billion in inflows, according to UK-based asset manager Farside Investors. Ten other funds tracking the performance of the largest cryptocurrency by market value have received a combined $21 billion in inflows.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)
since President Donald Trump named CEO Elon Musk to co-lead his new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a taskforce aimed at reducing federal spending. Price updates dinged
Tesla stock
last month, and at last check they are down 0.9% to trade at $358.26 today  -- on track for their fourth-straight drop and fresh off their sixth weekly loss in seven. The good news is this pullback has TSLA testing a historically bullish trendline.
Tesla's pullback has placed its 80-day moving average, which is a historically bullish trendline. According to Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, the equity has come within striking distance of this moving average after a prolonged period above it (defined by White as 80% of the time over the past two months and eight of the last 10 trading days) five times over the last three years. The stock was higher one month later after 60% of these signals, averaging a 5.3% gain.
TSLA 80 Day
A shift in analyst sentiment could push the shares even higher, as 24 of of the 38 firms in question carry a tepid ""hold"" or worse rating. Additionally, the 12-month consensus target price of $334.54 is a already a 6.5% discount to current levels.
Options look like a solid strategy when weighing in on TSLA. This is per its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 48% that sits in the 22nd percentile of its annual range, meaning options traders are pricing in low volatility expectations.

The Mag 7 look more like the “Lag 7” in 2025, as the
Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP)
has outperformed the traditional market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 index, as mega-cap tech stocks have been a performance drag.
The Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)—led the S&P 500 to two consecutive years of 20%+ returns but have mostly underperformed smallcap and midcap stocks this year.
Through Feb. 4, RSP was up 3% while the
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
rose 2.7%, and the
Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS)
lagged both with a 2.3% gain.
The performance story was quite different in 2024, as MAGS rocketed 64%, SPY jumped 25%, and RSP gained less than 13%.
Collectively, the Mag 7 stocks make up 33% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization and contributed over 50% of the S&P 500's gains last year, with an average increase of 63% among them.
Combining for such outsized influence, it’s no surprise that the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 would lag an equal-weight ETF like RSP, as four of the Mag 7 stocks have negative returns thus far in 2025.
Behind the Numbers
RSP’s 2025 outperformance can be attributed to several key factors:
Diversification Benefits:
RSP assigns equal weight to each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500, reducing the concentration risk associated with larger companies. In contrast, the traditional S&P 500 is heavily influenced by a few mega-cap stocks, particularly in the technology sector. When these dominant companies underperform, the equal-weighted approach of RSP can lead to better returns.
Performance of Smaller Constituents:
In 2025, the smaller, mid-sized companies within the S&P 500 have demonstrated strong performance, contributing positively to RSP's returns. The equal-weighted structure allows these companies to have a more significant impact on the ETF's overall performance compared to their influence on the market-cap-weighted index.
Sector Rotation:
Market dynamics in 2025 have favored sectors, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, that are underrepresented in the market-cap-weighted S&P 500. RSP's equal weighting provides broader exposure across all sectors, allowing investors to benefit from gains in sectors that may have less representation in the traditional index.
DeepSeek Selloff:
The introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, significantly impacted the performance of several mega-cap technology companies. DeepSeek's AI Assistant, utilizing its V3 model, has demonstrated capabilities comparable to leading AI models but at a fraction of the development cost. On January 27, 2025, following DeepSeek's announcement, major technology stocks experienced declines, most notably the Mag 7 constituent, Nvidia, which fell 17% that day. Other Mag 7 stocks in the red for 2025 include Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.
Story Continues
The bottom line is RSP's equal-weighted strategy offers more balanced exposure across all S&P 500 constituents, enabling it to capitalize on the strong performance of smaller companies and diverse sectors, leading to its outperformance relative to the traditional S&P 500 Index in 2025.
As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results and investors should consider multiple factors, including their financial goals and risk tolerance, before buying shares of any ETF.

But its car-selling business has become a sideshow to Elon Musk’s political prominence.

A large chunk of its mammoth market value has been propped up by hopes it will be among the first to develop and market fully self-driving vehicles. Those expectations were turbocharged by Donald Trump’s election victory, as investors bet the closeness between Tesla’s chief executive officer and the US President will pave the way — ignoring cash flow risks from a possible roll-back of EV incentives.
It’s almost as if the company’s ability to profitably build and sell the cars no longer counts. Trading in the options market suggests investors are preparing for a 7% move in either direction off Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, due after Wednesday’s market close. That would be the stock’s smallest post-results swing since October 2022. Shares fell as much as 3.4% on Wednesday, while the broader S&P 500 Index declined 0.9%.
“The market is behaving as if Tesla’s results don’t matter, and that may catch investors flat-footed in case of a large shock,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. “The electric car business is still about $200 billion in market value, but it is still the funding mechanism for a lot of the actual sideshows.”
The stock has added nearly $600 billion to its market value since reporting the last quarterly numbers. Yet in many ways, Tesla shares have become a vehicle for investors to wager on Musk himself, rather than the company. That has advantages, but also poses risks.
On one hand, the shares are now unencumbered by mundane details of growth and profitability. Earlier this month, the EV-maker reported fourth-quarter deliveries that missed analysts’ projections, and marked the first drop in annual sales in more than a decade. The stock, which is one of the most expensively valued in the S&P 500 Index, fell on the day before quickly rebounding.
The flip side is Tesla is now vulnerable to the twists and turns of a potentially volatile relationship. Musk last week openly questioned if companies that joined the Stargate artificial intelligence venture announced by Trump had the funds to follow through on promises. Trump and the Republican party are generally anti-EV, and the president has ordered his administration to consider eliminating related subsidies and policies.

That can be a major headache for Tesla, which in the third quarter of 2024 generated $739 million in revenue from selling regulatory credits to car manufacturers that need to comply with strict pollution standards. In the quarter before that, it hauled in $890 million. Barclays analyst Dan Levy estimates that about two-thirds of Tesla’s US sales, or 20% of its global sales, benefit from EV tax credits that encourage consumers to buy electric cars. It’s not yet clear how the different subsidies and incentives will be impacted.
“Fundamentals remain secondary versus the broader theme of narrative command for Tesla, which has gone into hyperdrive since the US Elections last November,” Levy wrote in a note to clients earlier this month. “It’s important to note this move has very little to do with EVs, as the Election catalyst is objectively a negative for EVs.”
The pitfalls of ascribing eye-watering valuations to future potentials — be it artificial intelligence or robotaxis — came into sharp focus Monday, when the biggest US technology stocks nosedived on fears that Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek could disrupt the current AI business model.
Between $500 billion and $600 billion of Tesla’s current market capitalization is based on its EV and energy businesses, according to Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally, with the rest pinned on efforts toward self-driving cars and humanoid robots. Calculations by Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, show that over 90% of Tesla’s share price is tied to what the company might do in the future.
Still, some say the very nature of Tesla’s core business can also protect it from a sudden DeepSeek-like shock.
“Any company is subject to disruption, but since the auto manufacturing business has a much longer cycle than computer software/hardware, I think that Tesla’s vulnerabilities will occur a bit more slowly,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.
A look into how traders are positioning for Tesla’s earnings report on Wednesday also shows optimism continues to rule. Citigroup equity and derivatives trading strategist Vishal Vivek estimated that options market positioning was about “7 out of 10 bullish.”
“Musk can engineer a stock rally with just a few words on the conference call even if the fourth-quarter numbers themselves are bad,” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of market intelligence firm Vital Knowledge. “That makes the stock extremely difficult to assess, especially around earnings.”
Tech Chart of the Day
ASML Holding NV surged the most since 2020 after booking orders worth twice as much as analysts expected, as the artificial intelligence boom fuels demand for its chipmaking machines. The Dutch company reported bookings of €7.09 billion ($7.4 billion) in the fourth quarter, it said in a statement on Wednesday. That compares with an average estimate of €3.53 billion by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.

The supplier to automakers including General Motors Co., Tesla Inc. and Volkswagen AG will reduce capital expenditure by 20% to 30%, it said in a filing on Friday. LG Energy confirmed a surprise 225.5 billion won ($157 million) operating loss for the three months ended Dec. 31. The result includes 377.3 billion won of tax credits from the US.
Still, LG Energy expects to see sales increase 5% to 10% this year as new assembly lines at North American plants jointly run with Honda Motor Co. and Stellantis NV start up. The company is also looking to start selling new products, including a next generation 46-millimeter cylindrical battery, Chief Financial Officer Lee Chang-sil said.
Click here to see details on LG’s final results
The mixed outlook from the world’s third-biggest EV battery supplier signals ongoing turbulence for the sector as demand slows. GM is shutting down its self-driving vehicle business, months after it scaled back its EV production goals. Meanwhile, European auto giants have seen sales in China soften and are struggling with stagnating consumer interest at home. VW has no new EV models to roll out this year, threatening to extend its sales slump, while BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz Group AG are shuffling their leadership teams.
The future of energy policy in the US is a major uncertainty for LG. The company currently receives tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, which is pushing to reduce US dependence on China in the EV supply chain. But President Donald Trump has ordered the elimination of subsidies and policies that favor EVs.
The US is likely to reduce or revoke the existing $7,500 EV subsidy and automakers appear to be taking a “conservative approach” due to remarks from the new Trump administration around policy changes, Lee said on a call. In the short term, LG will focus on investment efficiency, including cutting capex and focusing on existing plants rather than building new ones, he said.
While it’s not easy for Trump to revise the IRA, he can change some guidance in the law without the need for Congressional approval, Jamin Koo, a New York-based attorney at Covington, said last week. Trump may demand that battery makers reduce the use of critical minerals from so-called foreign entities of concern in their supply chains more than the Biden administration did, he said.
Story Continues
LG may benefit from a global push to reduce reliance on China for critical technologies like batteries. Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s biggest EV battery maker, was blacklisted by the US Defense Department earlier this month. Moves in Canada and European Union indicate tariffs may be enacted, which BloombergNEF says are likely to target China.
LG plans to start production at its lithium-iron-phosphate battery plant in Arizona in the first half of this year, earlier than the initial target of 2026, Lee said. The cells will be provided for energy storage systems, with strong demand in North America, he said.
The company’s earnings are likely to hit a bottom in the first quarter and it’s unlikely sales will rise from the fourth quarter.
Other key takeaways:
The company estimates it may receive tax credits under the IRA for about 50 gigawatt-hours.
LG’s Lee said the US is unlikely to cancel the production credit in the IRA, given it creates jobs.
LG is developing prismatic batteries with GM, although the timing for commercialization hasn’t been decided.
LG’s customers in North America trimmed their inventory during the quarter, leading to orders for fewer batteries. Such moves may end in the second quarter, and plans by GM to introduce a new EV would boost battery sales.

A
Tesla Inc
(NASDAQ:
TSLA
) analyst highlighted the monetization opportunities for the company with its
robotaxis and FSD.
The Tesla Analyst:
Goldman Sachs analyst
Mark Delaney
maintained a Neutral rating on Tesla with a $345 price target.
The Analyst Takeaways:
Improvement in Tesla's FSD saw robotaxi revenue now factored into Delaney's financial models for the company in a new investor note.
The analyst expects Tesla's robotaxis to begin operations in the second half of 2026 and hit revenue of around $115 million in 2027.

you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.
This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to
become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things.
Delaney's $115 million estimate was based on Tesla's robotaxi fleet hitting 300 vehicles by the end of 2026 and 1,500 vehicles by the end of 2027 with 20 trips per day per vehicle in 2027 and a price of $2.50 per mile.
""We believe that the performance of Tesla's FSD software has meaningfully improved with V13 compared to V12 based on our recent ride in a FSD V13-enabled Tesla vehicle, crowdsourced data, and third-party reviews,"" Delaney said.
Crowdsourced data showed more miles between interventions and 97% of drives not requiring a critical intervention, the report said.
""While we are encouraged by the improvement, recall that Tesla aims to be safer than a human driver in 2Q25, and FSD would need significant improvement to reach this level.""
While there is more work to be done on FSD, the analyst saw monetization levels picking up in 2026 and 2027.
""We believe long-term FSD monetization potential will not only depend on technical progress, but the degree to which Tesla's software is differentiated vs. other alternatives.""

Delaney also said FSD licensing to other OEMs could provide an upside scenario for Tesla and this business segment.
The incoming
Donald Trump
White House administration could change federal standards on robotaxi rules, the report also said.
Story Continues
This could help Tesla launch robotaxi services in several states and feature existing Tesla models first before launching the new Cybercab as part of the services.
""Globally, the market for robotaxis could reach billions of dollars in TAM at a high number of deployments and across operators.""
Delaney remains cautious about Tesla and sees ""valuation as full."" The analyst said the ramp in FSD could take longer than Tesla targets, auto fundamentals could remain volatile and auto delivery volumes could be lower than Tesla's outlook in 2025.
""We believe Tesla remains well positioned for long-term growth, given its leadership position in EVs; the breadth/depth of its technical capabilities in AI, software, and hardware; and its ability to benefit from a full set of solutions including in charging and storage.""

Europe's largest pension fund sold out of its stake in electric vehicle company
Tesla Inc
(NASDAQ:
TSLA
) during the third quarter, missing out on future gains and all-time highs hit after
the 2024 election.
What Happened: Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP
sold its entire stake in Tesla in the third quarter due to its thoughts on the $56 billion pay package for Tesla CEO
Elon Musk
, which shareholders approved in June 2024.
""We had a problem"" with Musk's pay package, a fund spokesperson told Bloomberg Sunday.
Don't Miss:
Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing —
you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.
If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a
7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it
?
While Musk's pay package was one of the main reasons for the sale, the fund spokesperson also said that costs, potential stock return and responsible investment requirements were reasons for the stock sale.
Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad first reported the Tesla stock sale by the pension fund and also cited poor working conditions from Tesla as a reason for the sale.
The stake was worth an estimated $585 million at the time of the sale, as reported by Bloomberg.
ABP voted against Musk's pay package shareholder proposal in June, saying it was ""controversial and exceptionally high.""
Shareholders approved the pay package in June, but the plan was rejected by a judge once again in December. Tesla has appealed the judge's decisions in the latest twist in the pay package saga.
Musk's pay package was worth $56 billion thanks to Tesla stock hitting all milestones set in the original pay compensation plan for the CEO.

ommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and
this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!
Why It's Important:
The pay package for Musk has been an overhang on the Tesla story and potentially the stock. If the appeal does not see the pay package go through, Tesla will likely need to pass a similar pay package for Musk and the Board of Directors warned that a new plan could be more costly.
The sale by ABP came ahead of Tesla stock hitting all-time highs, levels reached after
Donald Trump
won the 2024 presidential election.
Story Continues
Tesla stock soared after the election and hit all-time highs in 2024, helping Musk's wealth hit
the $400 billion level.
Tesla stock opened for trading at $201.02 on July 1 and closed at $261.63 on Sept. 30. During the quarter, Tesla stock traded between a low of $182.00 (Aug. 5) and a high of $265.60 (July 15).
Selling Tesla in the third quarter was likely costly for the pension fund, as the stock is currently up 45.7% to 112.7% from the low and high price in the third quarter, respectively, based on a price of $387.09 for shares at the time of writing.

TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",Why is the stock market down today ?  The market cant get a firm grip  ,20250104T054500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-stock-market-down-today-184853418.html,"Markets seesawed on the first trading day of 2025 as investors grappled with big questions ahead of a change of power in Washington.
U.S. stocks jumped in early trading, then zigzagged throughout the day. The broad S&P 500 closed down 13 points, or 0.2%, after trading as low as 0.9% lower midday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly half a percent at the close, while the Nasdaq Composite Index, which contains more technology stocks, cut early losses to close just 0.2% lower, near 19,281.
“The market can’t get a firm grip,” said Michael Grant, co-CIO and head of long/short strategies at Calamos Investments, which has $40 billion in assets.
“It's easy to imagine that the second coming of Trump will amplify these extraordinary premiums that exist for U.S. risk assets,” Grant told USA Today in a midday interview. “The conundrum is that this is actually going on for a long time.”
Even though December’s
“Santa Rally” fizzled
, the S&P 500 gained more than 23% in 2024. Stocks have notched double-digit annual returns most years in the decade, thanks largely to strong corporate profits in many sectors of the economy and expansive fiscal policy.
Some unease about whether those trends can continue may be starting to creep into the financial markets, Grant said.
“Investors need to scale back their expectations,"" he added. ""They need to avoid areas like Tesla, the AI narrative, and excessively valued growth stocks. Because that's where the real risk lies, particularly if interest rates stay higher for longer in 2025, which is one possible scenario.”
Shares of Tesla, Inc. lost a little more than 6% Thursday after the electric-car
company announced quarterly and full-year
2024 delivery numbers that were slightly lower than those in 2023. Investors may also have been reacting to the New Year’s Day
explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck
, which killed the driver, and is under investigation.
General view of the New York Stock Exchange.
Investors are also digesting the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will have to scale back its interest rate cuts – if not reverse course and hike rates at some point in 2025. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note has gained nearly a full percentage point since mid-September, when the central bank delivered its first rate cut in four years. Bonds lose their value, making yields rise, when inflation is higher.
Uncertainty about the future was reflected in the parts of the market that outperformed others on Thursday. Some sectors that are traditionally seen as defensive, or likely to do better in weaker economic conditions, advanced: utilities were up 0.8% and energy gained 1.2%, as calculated by the
Sector SPDR family of funds
.

TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",Ark Invest Cathie Wood Urges Trump Incoming Administration To Implement Retroactive Tax Cuts For Economic Boost From January 1,20241229T131500Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ark-invests-cathie-wood-urges-115812070.html,"Ark Invest's Cathie Wood Urges Trump's Incoming Administration To Implement Retroactive Tax Cuts For Economic Boost From January 1
Cathie Wood
, a well-known U.S. technology investor, is calling for clear tax policies from
Donald Trump
‘s incoming administration.
What Happened
: Wood proposes that tax cuts be retroactively applied from Jan. 1, to boost economic growth and provide policy certainty, Reuters reported on Friday.
“I see them saying, okay, we’re going to cut taxes but we will make them retroactive to Jan. 1, 2025. That would be very helpful, I think, in terms of providing certainty for the markets,” Wood said.

“If they don’t, you’re going to get companies and individuals perhaps holding back. ... I’m trying to communicate that pretty regularly to anyone who will listen.”
Wood’s primary fund,
ARK Innovation ETF
(NYSE:
ARKK
), has experienced a 17% increase following Trump’s electoral win, which is expected to bring about advantageous policy shifts. Stocks such as
Tesla Inc.
(NASDAQ:
TSLA
) and
Coinbase Global Inc.
(NASDAQ:
COIN
), which are in Wood’s flagship fund, have already seen notable gains since Nov. 6.
Wood has voiced her support for Trump’s economic strategies, which include fostering innovation in cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, streamlining regulations, and reducing government expenses. She stresses the importance of retroactive tax cuts to ensure market stability, cautioning that without them, businesses and individuals may be reluctant to invest.

While Wood typically opposes tariffs, she perceives Trump’s tariff threats as a strategic negotiation tool. Analysts predict that tax reform will be a focal point for the new Republican-majority Congress, with Trump expected to implement key policies through executive orders after his January 20 inauguration.
Wood, who did not financially back Trump in the 2024 election, maintains communication with
Elon Musk
and
Sen. Cynthia Lummis
(R – Wyo.) both of whom are influential in shaping Trump’s policies. Despite some market fluctuations, Wood remains hopeful about the ongoing influence of the ‘Trump bump’ on innovation-driven industries.
Why It Matters
: Wood has
previously expressed optimism
about the stock market’s potential under Trump’s leadership. In early December, she shared her belief that the market was beginning to anticipate a shift, noting a broadening out from a concentration on a few stocks.

This aligns with Trump’s own positive
outlook on the economy
, as he mentioned during a conversation with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, predicting “very good days ahead” for stocks, Bitcoin, and AI.

TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",Chinese EV Makers Hit EU Wall as Tariffs Add to Import Costs,20241223T180000Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-ev-makers-hit-eu-081008477.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese automakers captured their smallest share of Europe’s electric-vehicle market in eight months, after new tariffs added as much as 35% to the cost of importing cars to the region.

Manufacturers such as BYD Co. and SAIC Motor Corp.’s MG accounted for 7.4% of EV registrations across Europe in November, down from 8.2% in October, according to automotive researcher Dataforce. That’s the lowest level since March.
The European Union imposed the added tariffs at the end of October, after an investigation found that state aid had provided China’s EV industry with an unfair advantage. Months of talks failed to resolve the trade dispute, leading Brussels to tack the new fees onto an existing 10% import duty.
While all EVs produced in China are subject to the tariffs, including ones made by Western brands like BMW AG and Tesla Inc., the amounts vary depending on how much support an automaker received and whether it cooperated with the EU’s probe.
MG’s state-owned parent SAIC was hit hardest, with tariffs that now total 45%. Long the top-selling Chinese carmaker in Europe, the once-British sportscar brand has faltered recently, logging a 58% drop in registrations last month from a year earlier, based on data provided by Jato Dynamics, another research firm.
Amid MG’s retreat, BYD has pressed ahead, with registrations across Europe more than doubling in November to 4,796 vehicles.
“BYD is taking over the market while MG is taking major setbacks,” said Julian Litzinger, an analyst with Dataforce. BYD’s growth is healthy, he added, with nearly 80% of its registrations attributed to private and fleet customers.
Chinese carmakers, eager to expand to major global markets, have hit resistance in Europe after being effectively shut out from the US. The country’s worldwide EV exports fell 19% in November from a year earlier, according to Chinese customs data released on Monday, including a 23% drop to the EU.
Lower battery costs have given Chinese firms a price advantage, but the issue has stirred protectionist impulses as officials in the US and EU work to shield local automakers. The industry, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers in Germany, France and Italy, is struggling with the transition away from combustion-powered cars.
While the EU tariffs have blunted China’s push in the region, their introduction generally led to a smaller-than-expected setback, Litzinger said.

In Germany and France, however, EV registrations by Chinese manufacturers more than halved in November from a year earlier, he said. By contrast, Chinese EV makers posted a 17% year-over-year gain in the UK, which isn’t a member of the EU and hasn’t adopted the tariffs.
The shift toward EVs, once seen as inevitable, has slowed in 2024 in many global markets and become more unpredictable, leading automakers to reassess their strategies from model lineups to plant locations and even corporate structures.
Chinese automakers are taking steps to localize production in Europe, but those efforts will take time to mature.
Globally, car companies are looking for ways to share costs as they try to keep up on expensive technological change. Last week, it emerged that struggling Nissan Motor Co. was exploring a tie-up with fellow Japanese manufacturer Honda Motor Co., partly to strengthen their ability to compete in EVs.
