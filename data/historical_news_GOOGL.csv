Our Methodology

To select stocks for this list, we scoured the top stock picks as recommended by prominent financial websites like The Motley Fool, Forbes, Kiplinger, Investopedia, Morningstar, Zacks, Market Watch, and Business Insider. The top twenty consensus picks were then selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way.

In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

“Among our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels.

AI: A Consequential Technology

Artificial intelligence has taken the world by storm. AI has become one of the most exciting things to come out of the technology sector. As a result, some of the best AI stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others, are working the hardest to contribute to the AI race and maybe even lead it, have been attracting even larger amounts of investor attention. This is unsurprising, considering the immense growth AI has been undergoing. On February 14, George Lee, the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Office of Applied Innovation, discussed the growth potential of artificial intelligence, particularly with regard to geopolitics, and how geopolitics, in turn, may shape an AI-enabled future, on CNBC's ""Capital Connection."" Here are some of his comments:

""For me, where I specialize is really this intersection of generative AI and geopolitics. The rise of this new capability in the world is super consequential for countries and for regions, matters of economics, defense, and even culture itself, as Jensen Huang talked about the other day.""

On being asked how he expects machine intelligence to impact global growth, productivity, and the US-China conflict, Lee made the following comments:

""Well, our economists have called for a very significant impact, over a 10-year period, some 1.5% increase in global GDP as a result of this [AI]. Now, I think the important thing to reflect on that is that it's a 10 year interval. While this has arrived abruptly, it's hugely consequential and fascinating, it will take time for this to deepen its impact across economies around the world. And so, we're very focused on trying to monitor that, and I think, my personal view is that there is going to be remarkable productivity and economic gains emerging from this. There's also going to be an incredible leap in human creativity and productivity as we partner with machines just to address and solve challenges that have been prohibitively difficult in the past.""

According to Lee, humanity will likely evolve with machines and artificial intelligence, resulting in exceptional growth moving forward. He noted the following:

""In a sense, I think we will co-evolve with these machines, and look, we are very early days in this new generative AI revolution, but the pace of improvement, the trajectory of improvement, is so remarkable, that I think we do have to think pretty broadly about how we're going to co-exist with machines, how we're going to cooperate, and how, together, we can elevate humanity.""

Global Leaders in the AI Space

With the discussion on AI rapidly gaining speed and importance across the globe, many are beginning to wonder which global players will lead the way in this new global world order that is so heavily impacted by technology and artificial intelligence in particular. Lee gave his opinion on the matter of global leaders in the AI race as well. Here's what he had to say:

""The US and China have an early lead in this. Like other technology revolutions, such as the internet, a lot of this sprang from the US, both academic and commercial roots. China is somewhat challenged in this area, both because they're export-controlled away from some of the key technologies they need, and there's also this issue of the emergent quality of chatbots being somewhat threatening to regimes that are sensitive to social harmony and stability. But make no mistake, they are a formidable adversary and will be leaders in this space. You then have a series of countries, the EU, England, France, etc., who are going to be very consequential here, particularly in terms of regulation. Then you have countries that have a particular technology edge in this domain, those are places like Taiwan, South Korea, the Netherlands. And then, most interestingly, you have countries like the UAE... who have done extraordinary work in building their Falcon open source model, the work they've done around Arabic language foundation models, and just the general infrastructure investing they're doing.""

Considering the above highlights, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy, particularly the best small-cap AI stocks to buy now. These include some of the best cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.

GOOGL,2024-03-20,"In this article, we will look at the 12 best alternatives to a 4-year college. We have also discussed the decreasing value of college degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.

In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees due to several factors. One major reason is the rising cost of higher education, which has led many individuals to seek more affordable options. Additionally, the job market's evolving nature demands a broader range of skills and competencies, prompting a shift towards alternative pathways such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and online certifications.

However, it's essential to acknowledge the lasting benefits of a four-year college degree. Beyond providing specialized knowledge in a particular field, a bachelor's degree often cultivates critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable across various professions. Moreover, a college education opens doors to a broader range of career opportunities and typically leads to higher earning potential over the long term. In fact, there are easy college degrees that are quite high paying as well.

It is interesting to note that Liberal Arts is one of the easiest 4 year degrees to get. However, Liberal Arts is also one of the most useless associate degrees if you want high-paying jobs.

Moreover, data from the Burning Glass Institute highlights a decline in jobs requiring a college education, dropping from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021. Similarly, Gallup reports a stark decline in the percentage of young adults viewing college education as ""very important,"" plummeting from 74% to 41% within six years.

Companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are redefining hiring criteria, recognizing the value of life experiences over formal education. This sentiment is echoed in findings from Georgetown University, revealing that while a bachelor's degree holder may earn $2.8 million over a lifetime, non-degree holders can still expect $1.6 million in earnings, challenging conventional notions of the economic benefits of higher education.

Moreover, in 2016, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) introduced ""new collar"" roles, emphasizing transferable skills over bachelor's degrees. By 2020, 15% of hires included positions like application developer and cyber security specialist. In 2021, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) eliminated degree requirements for over half its US openings. The P-TECH program aided underprivileged students in acquiring tech skills and securing International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) internships. While International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) maintains lower degree requirements for roles like software QA engineer and network administrator, just 31% of software developer/engineer positions mandate a degree — the lowest among tech competitors per Burning Glass Institute data.

Furthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an average of 12 job changes over a career, emphasizing the importance of adaptable skills garnered from varied experiences. Initiatives such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s career certificates and innovative programs like Minerva University's immersive learning confirm the growing emphasis on experiential learning.

Another observation we tend to find is that inflation, whether in currency or credentials, obeys the principles of supply and demand. Just as rare items like vintage baseball cards command high prices due to scarcity, rare skills in the job market yield high wages. However, the widespread adoption of college degrees as a signaling tool has led to their devaluation. With 99.5 million Americans now holding bachelor's degrees, the once-esteemed credential has become commonplace. This phenomenon, known as credential inflation, sees jobs that once required only a high school diploma now demanding a bachelor's degree. Consequently, many recent graduates find themselves overqualified for low-paying jobs, contributing to underemployment rates. To read about unemployment rates, see the countries with the highest unemployment rates.

This is one of the best options other than college after high school as choosing to pursue an internship or an entry-level job over a 4-year college degree can offer several advantages.

7. Get Microcredentials and Nanodegrees

IM Score: 27

Microcredentials and Nanodegrees offer focused, specialized learning tailored to immediate industry needs, providing a quicker pathway to acquiring relevant skills compared to a traditional 4-year degree.

Turning to our recent fundraising of $355 million in convertible senior notes. With this financing, we believe we secured a large quantum of cost-effective and shareholder-friendly capital. The roughly $300 million of proceeds, net of our capped call and deal fees, positions the company to exercise inorganic adoptions to further vertically integrate our supply chain with the critical capabilities that are consistent with what we have done successfully in the past, which has enabled larger and more strategic program wins like the recent $0.5 billion SDA program.

On March 8 Jim Cramer during his program on CNBC said that the latest pullback in AI stocks shows how “fickle” the stock market can be. Cramer said while he is a big “believer” in AI, some stocks in the industry became too hot. While Jim Cramer keeps recommending investors to take some money off the table when stocks run too high, he’s still highly bullish on mega-cap tech stocks and AI plays like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). For example, last week, Jim Cramer advised a caller during his program to “stick” with Meta Platforms. Cramer said that the latest news around TikTok could become a “tailwind” for the social media company. Cramer yet again praised Mark Zuckerberg. Cramer is also advising investors to keep holding Alphabet despite the notion that it is behind in the AI race. Cramer said that he’s holding onto Alphabet because of what the company “can” do instead of what it’s currently doing. He thinks Alphabet has a lot of “optionality.”

Jim Cramer also talked about what he called the “new industrial revolution,” referring to major tech and AI plays. As expected, Cramer yet again highlighted the juggernaut that is Nvidia and said the company’s high performance chips have made it a monopoly in the industry and it would take a long time for other companies to catchup. Cramer said this monopoly was “born” because of “sweat, blood and tears” of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team.

Jim Cramer also said that the AI revolution is giving rise to a plethora of new applications and ecosystems which would help many companies in relevant sectors.

Jim Cramer advised investors to go in a “wait and see” mode and process the upcoming CPI and PPI reports before reaching to any conclusions about the Fed’s possible path in its battle against inflation.

SentinelOne is one of the fastest growing public cybersecurity companies, with revenue expected to grow more than 46% this fiscal year. Growth has been driven by a combination of: 1) market share capture from legacy endpoint vendors that struggle to compete against SentinelOne’s AI-enabled platform; 2) an ongoing shift of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to the cloud driving demand for cloud application protection (growing triple digits); and 3) cybersecurity vendor consolidation favoring end-to-end platforms with comprehensive security portfolios over single-point solutions.

Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle.

Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

In 2023, the world's top 20 hedge funds delivered significant returns of $67 billion, tripling the previous year's performance, as reported by LCH Investments in January 2024. TCI Fund Management, headed by billionaire Christopher Hohn, led the group with $12.9 billion in returns after fees. On average, the top 20 managers achieved a 10.5% gain in 2023, surpassing the industry's overall return of 6.4%. Multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, Millennium Management, and D. E. Shaw, known for using leverage, were the top three funds by lifetime gains. Despite representing only 4.6% of the industry's assets, these three firms generated 38.3% of the industry's returns over the past three years. Citadel, with $74 billion in gains since 1990, maintained its leading position in 2023, returning 15.3%, while also deciding to return approximately $7 billion to investors. Pershing Square, led by William Ackman, re-entered the rankings for the first time since 2015, securing the 20th position with $18.8 billion in returns since 2004, and achieving a return of 26.7% in 2023, outperforming the broader stock market. On the other hand, Bridgewater Associates and Caxton Associates were the only firms among the top 20 that posted losses. The strong performance in 2023 followed a challenging 2022 marked by market turbulence due to the war in Ukraine and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The top 20 hedge funds have collectively generated substantial profits, totaling $755.4 billion since their inception, surpassing their total managed assets of $655.5 billion, according to the research findings.

Brad Amiee, Director and Head of Research at LCH Investments, attributes the success of leading hedge funds in 2023 to the impressive performance of the stock market during the year. He noted that in addition to benefiting from the overall positive market conditions, many of these funds demonstrated particularly astute stock selection strategies. In a statement to Financial Times, Amiee said:

“You could argue that, since shorting is such a challenging sub-strategy, keeping things long-biased and having a concentrated portfolio of high quality positions has been the way to go.”

The robust performance of top financiers correlates with the overall stock market rally in 2023, particularly benefiting hedge funds that focus on specific stock picks. Many in the industry have heavily invested in the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. However, concerns are rising on Wall Street about the concentration of investments in these same companies. The data highlights a growing disparity in the hedge fund industry, with the top 20 firms managing just under 19% of the total $3.5 trillion assets but representing 46% of the sector's cumulative gains.

In 2024, global hedge funds are facing pressure to enhance returns due to a robust stock rally and increased bond yields, aiming to counteract investor outflows. Last year, investors withdrew a net $75 billion from hedge funds, following a significant outflow of $112 billion in 2022. Investors, seeking double-digit returns in 2024, are interested in credit, global macro, commodity, and equity long/short strategies. Some potential approaches include adopting ""barbell"" portfolios and exploring bond-trading strategies, given the potential impact of rising rates on refinancing costs for companies. Hedge funds focusing on diverse macroeconomic signals are also gaining attention, particularly as central banks are expected to adjust monetary policies.

Some of the most owned stocks by hedge funds include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

GOOGL,2024-03-04,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 16 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years. You can also directly check the 5 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years.

Consumer markets are dynamic and the introduction of new products represents both opportunity and risk for businesses. Over the past five years, numerous products have faced challenges and ultimately failed to achieve sustainable success in the marketplace. The unprecedented global event, COVID-19 pandemic, disrupted supply chains, altered consumer preferences, and reshaped the competitive landscape, posing formidable challenges for businesses across various industries.

According to McKinsey & Company, nearly 90% of companies experienced supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, significantly impacting their ability to deliver products effectively. Publicly traded companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) reported revenue declines as a result of these disruptions, highlighting the widespread impact on corporate performance.

Moreover, consumer behavior underwent significant changes during the pandemic, with a notable shift towards online shopping and digital consumption. A report by Adobe found that online sales surged by 32% in 2020 compared to the previous year, as consumers increasingly turned to e-commerce channels for their shopping needs. This shift accelerated the adoption of digital products and services while posing challenges for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and physical product-based businesses

In addition to pandemic-related challenges, businesses launching new products faced intensifying competition and higher consumer expectations in terms of quality, innovation, and value proposition. Nielsen research suggests that consumer trust in brands and products has become increasingly influenced by factors such as sustainability, social responsibility, and transparency.

From high-profile tech gadgets to innovative consumer goods, each product faced unique challenges that contributed to the downfall of products launched by many popular companies. For instance, publicly traded companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) faced setbacks with products like Google Pixel 4, which failed to impress consumers and critics due to mediocre battery life and lack of innovative features.

Therefore, Innovation remains a key driver of competitive advantage in today's business landscape. However, innovation without adequate market research, consumer insights, and risk assessment can lead to costly missteps. By analyzing the root causes of product failures and learning from past mistakes, businesses can refine their innovation processes, enhance product development strategies, and better align offerings with customer needs and preferences.

Moreover, collaboration and partnerships with external stakeholders, such as suppliers, distributors, and industry experts, can provide valuable insights and resources to support product development efforts. By fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, companies can leverage external expertise and perspectives to identify potential pitfalls and optimize product strategies.

In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and unprecedented global disruptions, businesses must remain agile, adaptable, and customer-centric to navigate the turbulent waters of the modern marketplace. Through a thorough understanding of past failures and a commitment to continuous improvement, businesses can position themselves for sustainable growth and success in the ever-changing business landscape.

Let's move to the list for the 16 failed products in the last 5 years.

Methodology

Our methodology for identifying the 16 failed products in the last 5 years involved conducting thorough research using Business Insider, Inc., 24/7 Wall St, Listverse, The Verge, and Boredpanda.

16 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years

16. LG G8 ThinQ (2019)

Score: 1

LG's flagship smartphone, the G8 ThinQ, boasted innovative features such as Hand ID and Air Motion gestures, aiming to differentiate itself in a crowded market. However, these features failed to resonate with consumers, who perceived them as gimmicky rather than practical. Additionally, the G8 ThinQ's design and specifications failed to stand out against competitors offering similar or superior performance at a lower price point. LG's marketing efforts struggled to effectively communicate the device's value proposition, resulting in lackluster sales and market penetration. The G8 ThinQ's failure led to the challenges of competing in the highly competitive smartphone market without delivering compelling innovation or value to consumers.

15. LG Rollable Smartphone (2021)

Score: 2

LG's rollable smartphone prototype, showcased with much anticipation at CES 2021, generated excitement for its innovative form factor and potential to redefine mobile device design. However, LG's sudden announcement of its decision to exit the smartphone market resulted in the cancellation of the rollable smartphone's commercial production. The rollable smartphone, which was poised to offer users a unique and flexible display experience, garnered praise for its forward-thinking design and engineering. However, LG's strategic pivot away from smartphones raised doubts about the company's commitment to innovation in the mobile industry. The cancellation of the rollable smartphone project disappointed consumers eagerly awaiting its release and underscored the challenges of executing ambitious projects in rapidly evolving markets.

14. Sony Xperia 1 (2019)

Score: 2

Sony's Xperia 1 entered the smartphone market with a focus on delivering premium features and a cinematic viewing experience. However, the device failed to gain traction among consumers due to several shortcomings. Despite its high price tag, the Xperia 1 offered lackluster camera performance compared to competitors in the same price range. Additionally, its limited availability through select carriers and retailers restricted its reach to potential buyers. The Xperia 1 also faced criticism for its tall and narrow form factor, which made it less comfortable to hold and operate compared to other smartphones. Despite Sony's reputation for quality and innovation in consumer electronics, the Xperia 1 failed to attract consumers looking for a flagship smartphone with a compelling value proposition, resulting in disappointing sales and market performance making it a failed product.

13. Uber Jump Electric Bikes (2019)

Score: 2

Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s ambitious venture into electric bike-sharing aimed to offer users a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. However, the service encountered numerous challenges that hindered its success. Regulatory issues, including permitting requirements and restrictions on where bikes could be parked, varied across different cities, leading to operational complexities and limited availability in certain areas. Moreover, vandalism and theft of Jump bikes posed significant financial burdens for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), requiring constant maintenance and replacement efforts. Operational challenges such as battery management and bike redistribution further strained the viability of the service. Despite initial enthusiasm for electric bike-sharing as a sustainable transportation solution, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s struggles with Jump bikes showed the complexities of implementing urban mobility initiatives amidst regulatory hurdles and operational challenges.

12. Google Pixel 4 (2019)

Score: 3

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google Pixel 4 flagship smartphone failed to meet expectations set by its predecessors, facing criticism for several shortcomings. Despite Google's reputation for innovative software, the Pixel 4 disappointed users and critics alike with its underwhelming battery life, which struggled to last through a full day of use. Additionally, the device lacked groundbreaking features to differentiate itself from competitors in the crowded smartphone market. The Pixel 4's high price tag, coupled with its lackluster hardware specifications relative to its competitors, deterred potential buyers seeking value for money. Moreover, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s decision to omit a fingerprint sensor in favor of facial recognition technology received mixed reviews, with some users expressing concerns about its reliability and security. The Pixel 4's lackluster reception underscored the challenges of competing in the fiercely competitive smartphone market without delivering significant innovation or value proposition to consumers.

11. Nintendo Labo (2018-2019)

Score: 3

Nintendo Labo was an innovative concept that combined do-it-yourself cardboard accessories with interactive gaming experiences for the Nintendo Switch console. Launched with multiple kits offering various gameplay possibilities, Nintendo Labo initially generated excitement among gamers and families. However, the novelty of the cardboard construction and limited replay value led to waning interest after the initial launch period. Despite offering unique gaming experiences, Nintendo Labo failed to maintain momentum due to its high price point relative to its perceived value. The lack of ongoing support and updates for new Labo kits further limited its appeal and contributed to its decline in popularity. While Nintendo Labo showcased Nintendo's creativity and commitment to innovation, its failure to sustain interest laid the foundation of the challenges of introducing new gaming concepts into a competitive market without addressing fundamental user needs and preferences.

10. Segway PT (Personal Transporter) (2001-2020)

Score: 3

Marketed as a revolutionary mode of personal transportation, the Segway PT garnered widespread attention upon its debut. With its self-balancing technology and sleek design, the Segway promised to transform urban commuting and personal mobility. However, its high price tag and niche appeal limited its adoption beyond certain niche markets, such as tourism and security. Additionally, concerns over safety and regulatory restrictions hindered widespread adoption of the Segway PT in urban environments. Despite attempts to diversify its product lineup and target new consumer segments, Segway struggled to overcome its image as a novelty or luxury item. The company's decision to discontinue production of the Segway PT in 2020 marked the end of an era for the iconic personal transporter.

9. Google+ (2011-2019)

Score: 4

Google+ was Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s ambitious venture into social networking, aiming to challenge Facebook's dominance. Launched with features like Circles for personalized sharing and Hangouts for group video calls, Google+ initially attracted a significant user base. However, it failed to maintain momentum due to complex user interface and integration issues with other Google services. Moreover, the platform's struggle with identity management and the lack of killer features compared to existing social networks hampered its growth. Security breaches, including one in 2018 that exposed users' private data, further undermined trust in the platform. Despite efforts to revitalize it, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced the closure of Google+ in 2019, citing low user engagement and the challenge of addressing security concerns.

8. Amazon Echo Loop (2019)

Score: 4

Amazon's Echo Loop represented the company's foray into wearable technology with a smart ring featuring Alexa integration. However, the device failed to gain traction among consumers due to its limited functionality and uncomfortable design. Despite offering basic voice assistant capabilities, the Echo Loop lacked the versatility and utility of other Echo devices, such as smart speakers and displays. Additionally, its bulky and conspicuous design made it impractical for everyday wear, limiting its appeal to consumers seeking a seamless and unobtrusive smart assistant experience. Despite Amazon's marketing efforts, the Echo Loop failed to resonate with consumers, highlighting the challenges of introducing new form factors into the wearable tech market without addressing key user needs and preferences.

7. Google Stadia (2019)

Score: 4

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google Stadia aimed to revolutionize the gaming industry by offering cloud-based gaming experiences accessible across various devices without the need for high-end hardware. Promising seamless gameplay and instant access to a library of titles, Stadia generated significant excitement upon its announcement. However, the platform faced numerous challenges, including a limited game library at launch and performance issues such as input lag and latency. Furthermore, the subscription model and pricing structure for games on Stadia were confusing for consumers, leading to uncertainty and hesitancy to adopt the platform. Despite Google's investment in infrastructure and partnerships with game developers, Stadia failed to gain widespread adoption and faced criticism from both gamers and industry analysts.

6. Google Clips (2018-2019)

Score: 4

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI-powered camera, Google Clips, aimed to capture candid moments using machine learning algorithms. However, the device failed to gain widespread adoption due to concerns over privacy and limited functionality. Despite Google's efforts to position Clips as a convenient and innovative camera accessory, its reception fell short of expectations. Consumers were apprehensive about the device's always-on recording capabilities, raising privacy concerns in homes and public spaces. Moreover, the device's limited functionality and lack of user control over content creation limited its appeal to consumers seeking more versatile photography solutions. Despite Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s attempt to cater to a niche market segment with Clips, its failure to address fundamental user concerns and deliver compelling features resulted in lackluster sales and market reception.

GOOGL,2024-03-03,"Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments, talks with Financial Post’s Larysa Harapyn about which stocks are attractive among the so-called Magnificent Seven, which includes Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., and Tesla Inc., and which ones to avoid.

GOOGL,2024-03-01,"Roundhill Investments, the thematic ETF issuer with $870.7 million in assets, is doubling down on the Magnificent Seven with a pair of funds, including one for bets the stocks will rise and the other for investors who want to profit on their decline.

The asset manager known for its metaverse and gaming exchange-traded funds launched the Roundhill Daily 2X Long Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGX), which offers twice the daily performance of the famed seven tech equities, by investing at least 80% of its portfolio in equal weight exposure to Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Tesla Inc. The Roundhill Daily Inverse Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGQ) give inverse exposure to the same basket of stocks.

The funds, which began trading today, are designed for ""sophisticated traders,"" the company said in a statement. MAGX dropped 1.6% to $25.15 in afternoon trading while MAGQ rose 0.1% to $24.86.

The seven stocks were coined the “Magnificent Seven” as they largely drove the bull market that started last year. The group makes up about a quarter of the value of the 3,700 or so publicly traded U.S. companies. Fueled by artificial intelligence excitement and the launch of AI products such as Chat GPT, investors bet big on chipmakers like Nvidia and chatbot creators such as Microsoft.

“We saw an opportunity to provide both investors and traders with the full toolkit to express their opinion on the Magnificent Seven,” explained Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer of Roundhill in an interview with etf.com about the new launches.

The launch follows the November conversion of Roundhill's BIGT fund into the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which has not had a day of outflows so far this year, pulling in $106.2 million while gaining 13%, according to etf.com data.

While MAGS is for investors, MAGX and MAGQ is for traders, Mazza said.

“Particularly the 2x version is only appropriate for traders who have the ability to monitor their positions on a daily basis,” explained Mazza.

GOOGL,2024-02-29,"In this article, we will take a look at the 25 companies with the best benefits and perks. If you would like to skip our discussion on the global workforce trends, you can go to the 5 Companies with the Best Benefits and Perks.

In today's dynamic business environment, attracting top talent requires more than just competitive salaries; it demands a comprehensive benefits package that will address the diverse needs of a modern workforce. Companies that offer various perks not only enhance their attractiveness as employers but also leverage these benefits as strategic tools for business growth and sustainability.

This is evidenced by the fact that organizations recognized for their superior employee benefits often report lower turnover rates, translating to significant cost savings in recruitment and training. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 56% of US employees consider employer-sponsored health benefits when deciding to stay in their current job. When it comes to identifying the best employee benefits companies, it's important to explore various sectors, including tech giants and manufacturing firms. This helps in understanding how innovative benefits can shape business outcomes and employee satisfaction. The companies that lead in this realm not only offer traditional perks but also prioritize the holistic well-being of both full-time and part-time employees.

Workplace Evolution: Changing Expectations of Today's Workers

A Microsoft survey from 2021 found that 41% of workers globally were thinking about leaving their jobs within the next year, showing how people's expectations from their workplaces are changing. Health benefits are now crucial for employee satisfaction, as highlighted in another 2021 Glassdoor survey where 40% of the respondents said health insurance is the most important benefit. Furthermore, the desire for flexible work is also growing. In a 2022 FlexJobs survey, 56% of participants said they'd consider finding a new job if remote work options were taken away. Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) are adapting to these changing needs of employees by introducing flexible policies.

At Google, a key player under Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), there's significant emphasis on creating a rich workplace culture and extending a wide range of benefits to its employees. This commitment has consistently positioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the top of employee satisfaction surveys, highlighting the importance of employee well-being in achieving organizational excellence. This has also helped improve Alphabet's financial performance, with the company achieving a remarkable 13.49% growth in revenue in the final quarter of 2023. Similarly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also prioritizes employee benefits and is one of the companies with the best health benefits. With perks like healthcare, parental leave, and development opportunities, Microsoft has created a workplace that promotes a positive culture and boosts innovation and productivity. This approach has been vital to Microsoft's ongoing financial success, consistently reaching a market capitalization of over a trillion dollars. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is another company that promotes a deep sense of unity and community among its staff. Salesforce's commitment to its employees is evident in its low attrition rates and high satisfaction scores. With consistent year-over-year growth, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) remains a leader in the customer relationship management sector.

Here’s what Vulcan Value Partners said about Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:

“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the world’s leading SaaS vendor for customer relationship management (CRM) and salesforce automation (SFA) software. The company offers many other products including software for marketing automation, customer service automation, analytics, application integration, and enterprise collaboration among others. During the quarter, Salesforce increased guidance for the fiscal year including higher revenue growth, higher free cash flow growth, and higher operating margins. The company also indicated it is seeing a less measured buying environment and more business opportunities, indicating the macro environment is getting relatively better for them. Salesforce is deeply entrenched within its customer base, has high retention, high recurring revenue, and is a very scalable business with high margin potential. Salesforce is dominant across its offerings and is constantly innovating with new products, features, and artificial intelligence to deepen customer relationships and grow the business.”

GOOGL,2024-02-26,"In this article, we discuss the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the financial markets and expert outlook, go directly to the 5 Stocks That Will Make You Rich In 2024.

So far, the Fed’s efforts have managed to contain the inflation and is expected to push the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession like the European countries such as the U.K. and Germany experienced.

Last year was another strange year for the market as it was believed that the US economy would go into a recession. However, the complete opposite happened, and the S&P 500 was able to manage gains of over 25%. While it is believed that growth stocks usually perform well during interest rate cuts and have bearish outcomes during economic downturns, the economy was saved by the technology sector, which is dominated by growth stocks. Companies like Nvidia and Meta saw triple-digit growth and are still up 63.63% and 39.78% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of market closing on February 23.

It is important to note that while it is a popular belief that AI and semiconductor stocks were the top performers of the year, it is not entirely true. Blockchain and crypto news were wildly overshadowed by the AI revolution. Some of the best-performing ETFs included Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) and Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI). However, cryptocurrencies have shown a significant amount of volatility in the first two months of the year.

While the Fed has not been clear on its rate-cutting position in 2024, experts believe that it might start in the first half of the year, which means that growth stocks might make you rich in 2024. Although experts still have mixed opinions about the current year, you can still take a look at 14 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Right Now, which also contains a list of stocks with the potential to make you rich in 2024.

2024 Outlook According to Analysts

Even though 2023 was a great year for the market, many analysts believe that the current year might not be as great and should be an average year. It shouldn’t come as a surprise as the news of a soft landing has been spreading around. The “average year” analysis is provided by Morgan Stanley, which believes in it due to normalizing financial conditions, excessive valuations, and a few other factors. The firm suggests maintaining a preference for value stocks as compared to growth stocks at least till the first rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

On the other hand, B.Riley and JP Morgan have quite bullish views about the future of the market. One of their main concerns is the over-valuation of stocks due to the 2023 rally. JP Morgan warns about a potential 20% to 30% dip in the market, while B. Riley Strategist Paul Dietrich predicts a mild recession, which could steer the market toward a 40% decline.

While most analysts believe in a mediocre market performance this year, there are still some investments that can make you rich. For this purpose, we created a list of stocks that could make you rich in 2024, and some of them include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).

GOOGL,2024-02-25,"In this article, we will take a look at the 15 states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024. If you would like to skip our discussion on the US economy, you can go to the 5 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024.

While headlines boast of a historically low national unemployment rate of 3.7% in 2023, there have been massive layoffs totaling 19.8 million during the last year as compared to 17.6 million layoffs in 2022. In January 2024, 82,307 job cuts were announced, which is an increase of 136% from December 2023. Moreover, many different companies across the USA have announced job cuts this year in order to curtail rising costs amid uncertain economic conditions. In fact, a survey conducted by The Conference Board revealed that 23% of the CEOs are planning to lay off employees in the next 12 months. This is 13% more than in the previous quarter.

The brunt of these layoffs is not evenly distributed across sectors. Technology companies, while navigating the current economic uncertainty, are witnessing a significant number of job cuts. In January 2024 alone, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced 5% job cuts in its audiobooks and podcast division, 35% in the streaming unit, and several hundred in the streaming and studio operations. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also announced hundreds of layoffs in the same month. So far, more than 140 companies in the tech space have laid off over 34,000 employees in 2024. In 2023, more than 1,160 tech companies laid off 262,000 employees. The major reason for the significant number of layoffs is the slowdown after the hiring spree within the sector in recent years.

Here's what Baron Funds said about Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:

“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares of Amazon were up 19.5% in the quarter and finished the year up 80.9%. Reported quarterly results were better than consensus estimates with 11% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, a significant beat in North American operating profit as operating margins reached 4.9% and a recovery in the cloud division, AWS, which grew 12% year-over-year and management reported that the impact of customer optimizations was attenuating. We believe that AWS has many years of growth ahead as IT budgets continue switching from on premise to the cloud and as Amazon remains the clear leader in the market, with large incremental opportunities in application software, including enabling GenAI workloads. We also believe Amazon is well positioned in the short-to-medium term to further improve core North American retail profitability to above pre-pandemic levels, benefiting from its new regionalized fulfillment network and its growing margin-accretive advertising business. Longer term, Amazon has substantially more room to grow in e-commerce, where it has less than 15% penetration of the total addressable market.”

Media is another industry that has reported many job cuts recently. In 2023, 20,324 layoffs were announced in this industry. Many big names in media have announced layoffs in 2024, including Business Insider (8% of staff), Los Angeles Times (94 journalists), and Paramount Global (3% of the workforce). The main reason is the rise in popularity of the Internet as a one-stop shop for advertisers. Moreover, consumers are becoming more price-conscious as far as news or informational articles are concerned. Other industries announcing a significant number of layoffs include retail and even automotive. The drop in consumer spending, especially in retail, and the demand for a better bottom line have both led to a drive to cut costs, thereby cutting jobs.

In addition to variation by industry, there is a lot of disparity in the unemployment rate by state. The lowest unemployment rate by state in 2023 was in Maryland, and the highest unemployment rate by state in the same year was in Nevada. In this scenario, unemployment benefits serve as a crucial safety net, providing temporary financial assistance to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. However, unemployment benefits by state vary significantly in terms of nature and duration, highlighting stark disparities in how different regions address unemployment. Each state has a different methodology for calculating unemployment benefits as well as the employment tax rate, which provides the funds for these benefits.

Our Methodology

To compile our list of the 15 states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024, we made use of three weighted metrics, namely the average weekly benefit (weight of 0.4), cost of living index (weight of 0.3), and the number of weeks these benefits extend (weight of 0.3). We then ranked the worst states for unemployment benefits on all three of these metrics. Then, we computed a weighted average of states' rankings across these three criteria and adjusted the final rankings accordingly. The states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024 have been ranked in descending order of their scores.

By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.

15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024

15. Connecticut

Weighted Average Score: 7.2

Connecticut provides unemployment benefits for a period of 26 weeks. The state achieved a noteworthy milestone in economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in November 2023, when employment levels surpassed pre-pandemic levels.

14. Maine

Weighted Average Score: 7.1

Maine experienced an increase in its unemployment rate, reaching 3.2% in January 2024. Despite this upward trend for the fifth consecutive month, the rate remained lower than the overall US unemployment rate and marked the lowest rate on record for the state. However, Maine's unemployment insurance system has faced challenges in meeting the needs of its citizens.

13. Arkansas

Weighted Average Score: 7.1

Arkansas ranks thirteenth on the list of states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024. In addition to the low cap on unemployment benefits, the maximum duration of the benefits in Arkansas is also short as compared to the standard 26 weeks practiced in many states. The unemployment rate in Arkansas was 3.4% in December 2023.

12. Virginia

Weighted Average Score: 6.8

As of February 2023, the unemployment insurance program in Virginia offers a maximum of 26 weeks of benefits. The benefit amounts vary, starting from a minimum of $60 per week and reaching a maximum of $378 per week. Virginia infrequently revisits its unemployment benefits structure. However, the state has a low unemployment rate, which was recorded at 2.7% in December 2023.

11. District of Columbia

Weighted Average Score: 6.7

In December 2023, the unemployment rate in the District of Columbia was 5.1%, showing a 0.1% increase from November 2023 and remaining higher than other states. The District of Employment Services (DOES) has faced widespread criticism for delays in processing unemployment benefit claims amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this criticism, DOES has revamped its unemployment insurance benefits system to simplify the application process and address issues related to fraud.

10. Tennessee

Weighted Average Score: 6.2

With an unemployment rate of 3.5% in December 2023, Tennessee is another state with an average unemployment rate and low unemployment benefits. The unemployment benefits in Tennessee are less than the minimum wage. This leaves the unemployed with hardly any money for sustenance.

9. South Carolina

Weighted Average Score: 6.1

South Carolina faces challenges in its unemployment benefits system, not only offering low benefits but also presenting complexities in the application process. With a complex system in place, only 14.8% of the unemployed population manages to access unemployment benefits in the state. Furthermore, South Carolina's eligibility period for unemployment benefits stands at 20 weeks, which is shorter compared to the standard 26 weeks practiced in many states.

8. New Hampshire

Weighted Average Score: 5.8

The unemployment rate in New Hampshire was recorded at just 2.5% in December 2023, lower than the national average. While the state’s economy managed to rebound from the COVID-19 recession in a fairly short amount of time, the rising cost of living has increased the citizen’s hardships.

7. California

Weighted Average Score: 5.8

In California, the unemployment rate rose to 5.1% in December 2023. Approximately one in four unemployment benefits claims were rejected during the pandemic for various reasons. Additionally, California's unemployment benefits have not been updated for over two decades and do not adequately cover the cost of living. Hence, California is considered one of the states with the worst unemployment benefits. Silicon Valley, situated in California's Bay Area, continues to be the largest tech hub, with companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) located there.

6. Delaware

Weighted Average Score: 5.7

In Delaware, a bill was recently passed to improve the state’s unemployment benefits, which have been constant since 2019. As of December 2023, the unemployment rate in Delaware stands at 4.20%, indicating no change from the previous month and a decrease from the 4.60% recorded in 2022. This figure is also below the long-term average of 5.25%.

GOOGL,2024-02-25,"In this article, we discuss the 11 cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence industry, go directly to the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit the ground running since last year, and there seems to be no end in sight to it in the near future. The PwC Emerging Technology Survey suggests that after the launch of ChatGPT, more than half of the surveyed companies have introduced generative AI in some form to their business. The AI stocks also performed quite well in 2023 and are still trending in 2024. The Magnificent 7 stocks outperformed the rest of the S&P 493 heavily in the year, and analysts like Goldman Sachs' David Kostin are positive that the gains will continue in 2024. The seven big tech stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which were the top performers of the group, collectively gained around 75% during the previous year compared to 12% gains for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index.

Other than the big tech, AI technology gave a boost to a range of AI companies. The Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (IGPT) gained over 30% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 25% growth. Moreover, the ETF is also 15.80% higher year-to-date (YTD) at the time of the February 23 market close, compared to the S&P 500’s 7.3% gains.

AI is changing the face of every sector in the market. For example, the mortgage finance company Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE:RKT) uses AI for mortgage banking, underwriting, and servicing. In 2023, The company piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers and outbound client calls.

In addition, the real estate company Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) sets up networks and data centers, making it quite exposed to potential growth in AI computer facilities. At the company’s Q4 2023 earnings call CEO Charles Meyers said:

“We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.

Effects of AI on Labor

An International Monetary Fund (IMF) report defines AI as a double-edged sword. While AI can potentially create many jobs, it can also replace human labor in several other areas. The IMF believes that nearly 40% of the jobs around the world are exposed to AI. In the developed countries, 60% of the jobs will be affected by the new technology creating a higher risk/reward situation for their labor markets. However, the report mentions that wealthier countries are also better equipped to adopt AI.

For emerging economies and under-developed nations, the IMF suggests laying concrete groundwork and infrastructure to be better prepared for the AI revolution in the job market.

The artificial intelligence industry is on the rise, and it’s significantly far away from its peak. This creates some entry points for investors in cheap AI companies. Keeping that in mind, some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024 include Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).

Our Methodology

For this article, we identified 30 stocks trading on NYSE and NASDAQ that directly benefit from the rise of AI or are actively working for the growth of the artificial intelligence space. Next, we chose the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside as of February 23. The analyst price targets were taken from TipRanks. We only chose the companies that were covered by at least two analysts and didn’t have many Hold or Sell ratings, as compared to Buy-equivalent ratings. The 11 best cheap AI stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside.

We also added the number of hedge fund investors for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.95%

Average Analyst Price Target: $206.15

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is famously known for its signature consumer electronics and more, but it has been working tirelessly to integrate AI and machine learning into its products.

On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable by February 15 to the shareholders of record on February 12. The stock’s dividend yield was 0.53% as of the February 23 market close.

In the first quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a GAAP EPS of $2.18, surpassing the analysts’ estimates by $0.07. The revenue jumped 2.1% year-over-year (YoY) to $119.6 billion, topping the estimates by $1.34 billion.

Mairs & Power mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“The Fund’s relative performance was negatively impacted by what we didn’t own as well. In particular, not holding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for most of the year cost the Fund more than 300bps (basis points) of performance. Apple may be the best-known company in the world and its seemingly ubiquitous iPhone holds a dominant share of the global cell phone market. Apple is even more dominant among Millennials and Gen Zers, which should lead to even greater market share as these cohorts age. This loyal user base should pay huge dividends for shareholders as Apple continues to monetize this ecosystem, especially as the company delves deeper into services, payments, and AI. We initiated a position in Apple during the fourth quarter and await a more attractive entry point to add to our position.”

9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Average Analyst Price Target: $164.59

8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.44%

Average Analyst Price Target: $469.58

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 302

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been long making headlines in the AI industry with its investments in AI companies and AI products like Azure AI.

On February 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith took to Twitter and announced that the company would be investing $2.1 billion over the next two years to develop the AI infrastructure in Spain.

On February 15, it was reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning on furthering the AI infrastructure in Germany through an investment of 3.2 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in the next two years.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was mentioned in Baron Funds’ fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Our biggest purchase in the fourth quarter was a new position we initiated in the software platform Microsoft Corporation. While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund, we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy. However, Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric, on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers. Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly. Over time, Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share, while becoming a more important driver for the company. For example, in the last quarterly earnings release, Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors. A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year. Just to put this in perspective, $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business, it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue. We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner, global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $4.7 trillion worldwide IT spending.

7. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 17.66%

Average Analyst Price Target: $122.30

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20

Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a California-based company that designs and sells user interface solutions, and many of them are integrated with AI, like its Smart Home SoC solution. It ranks seventh on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.

On February 9, Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy raised the price target on Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)’s stock to $130 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.

On February 8, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) released its Q2 earnings result with a non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, which beat the estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $237 million topped the estimates by $1.33 million.

TimesSquare Capital Management made the following comment about Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:

“In the Information Technology sector, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) develops and markets semiconductor product solutions. Their products enable users to interact more easily with smartphones, notebooks, tablets, and other portable multi-media devices. While the fiscal third quarter results were in line with sell-side projections, forward guidance was worse than expected. Management sees growing macroeconomic headwinds further impacting IT budgets, and the inventory draw-down has been slower than they had anticipated on weaker sell-through trends. Synaptics lost -23% and we added to the position.”

6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) are some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, besides Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).

Polen Capital commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

As we navigate through 2024, the outlook for both the stock and bond markets experiences regular fluctuations, driven by a myriad of factors including economic data releases, Federal Reserve communications, and shifts in interest rate forecasts. Initially, investors anticipated multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve over the year, with expectations of the first cut occurring in March. However, in light of a string of favorable economic indicators, the Fed has signaled that a rate cut in March is unlikely. As a result, investors are recalibrating their assessments of stocks and bonds, anticipating fewer rate cuts to commence at a later date than previously anticipated.

The Commerce Department's report on economic growth reveals a 3.1% year-over-year expansion in the fourth quarter of 2023, fueled by robust consumer spending in sectors like healthcare, dining, and automobiles. This robust performance, combined with potential future rate cuts, has bolstered market sentiment, with bulls expressing optimism and setting higher targets for the S&P 500 index. Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, suggested that the S&P 500 could reach 6,100 in the long term if new highs are reached. Despite certain stocks being overbought, Stockton highlighted signs of market strength, signaling the start of a bull market.

On a contrasting note, analysts with a long-term perspective anticipate that the Federal Reserve will eventually commence rate cuts. At the same time, robust earnings growth and economic resilience will propel the S&P 500 upward towards the end of 2024. Goldman Sachs has recently revised its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,200, an increase from its earlier projection of 5,100. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs anticipates that the robust earnings performance of mega-cap stocks, particularly those within the Magnificent Seven group, will play a significant role in driving S&P 500 profits in 2024.

Given the circumstances outlined above, it’s no wonder that renowned companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remain top contenders as some of the best revenue stocks to invest in, both in the eyes of analysts and investors.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google has told suppliers to start making its Pixel smartphones in India by next quarter at the earliest, as part of its plan to ship more than 10 million Pixel phones this year, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday.

Google would start manufacturing smartphones in India and its flagship Pixel 8 will be available in 2024, it said last October, as it focuses more on a key growth market.

The move will also help Google diversify its supply chain away from China, the Nikkei report said, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

The tech giant will prepare production lines for its high-end Pixel 8 Pro smartphones in the coming weeks and start producing phones in the April-June quarter, the report added, citing multiple sources.

The report did not say how many phones Google plans to manufacture India nor if the phones will be for sale in the country or for exports.

Google did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

GOOGL,2024-02-12,"Microsoft is the world largest company in terms of market cap, according to a new study.

CEOWORLD Magazine recently ranked the world’s largest companies by market cap, which refers to the total dollar market value of a company’s outstanding shares of stock. Among the largest companies were Microsoft ($3 trillion market cap), Apple ($2.87 trillion market cap), Saudi Arabian Oil Company ($2 trillion market cap), Amazon ($1.87 trillion market cap), and Alphabet Inc. ($1.77 trillion market cap).

U.S. COMPANIES DOMINATE TOP 20

Among the top 20 companies by market cap, U.S. companies reigned supreme. Only four non-U.S. companies made the top 20, including Saudi Arabian Oil Company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Novo Nordisk A/S, and LVMH.

Several U.S. companies from last year’s list still maintained top rankings in this year’s list. Apple, which ranked number one last year, fell to number two this year. Microsoft, which ranked number two last year, secured the top spot this year.

A number of companies made this year’s top 25 that weren’t on last year’s ranking. Home Depot, Adobe, Chevron, and Salesforce all secured spots in this year’s top 25.

Overall, the ranking includes companies from 12 different countries, including the United States, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Denmark, and France. The total revenue for the entire CEOWOLRD 50 Global stands at $29.63 trillion – the equivalent of 6.7 times Germany’s GDP.

Top 15 MBA Interview Questions, According to Experts

Securing an MBA interview is a huge accomplishment—and often it means you’re close to the finish line.

“While some MBA programs interview all applicants, in most cases getting asked to interview is a sign that your application and profile are compelling, and the admissions committee can see a potential place for you in the upcoming class,” Erin Wand, an admissions consultant at mba.com, says.

Preparing for your interview beforehand is key to success. The experts at simplilearn recently compiled a list of the top MBA interview questions that admissions officers use to determine whether or not you are the right fit for their B-school.

“TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF”

This question is usually asked as a conversation starter to better understand your background, experience, and accomplishments. Try to limit your response to two to three minutes and prepare essential talking points beforehand including: Your undergraduate experience and why you chose the major that you did, work experience and accomplishments from the past and present, and your career objectives.

“WHAT MOTIVATES YOU TO PURSUE AN MBA?”

With this question, admissions officers are trying to see whether or not you have a well-thought-out approach to your MBA journey. Explaining the “why” is key to answering this question clearly.

“Explain why you want to get a master's degree in business administration and how it will help you reach your career goals,” according to simplilearn. “Emphasize the precise talents you want to develop and how they relate to the field, job function, or sector you're interested in. What prompted you to pursue this degree at this time?”

“WHY THIS BUSINESS SCHOOL?”

Nearly every interview will include a “why our school” question. Experts recommend crafting your response in a way that demonstrates your fit with the B-school and its culture and offerings.

“Mention your achievements, emphasize the abilities you've developed so far in your career, and explain how your academic and professional experience will benefit others in the program,” according to simplilearn.

It can also be beneficial to highlight direct opportunities at the B-school that align with your goals.

“Tell the admissions committee or interviewer what classes and majors interest you, and why,” Stephanie Horn, an admissions consultant at Admissionado, says. “Show them you have gone beyond the school landing pages to really dig into how you can customize your classes to meet your unique needs and future goals.”

“WHAT WOULD YOUR CO-WORKERS, SUPERVISOR, OR FRIENDS SAY ABOUT YOU?”

This personality question is designed to better understand your professional and personal traits. Experts recommend utilizing points from your letter of recommendation to paint an authentic picture of who you are.

“It's most likely the person who wrote your letter of recommendation, if they say, supervisor,” according to simplilearn. “As a result, avoid making things up because any inaccuracies may create suspicion.”

TOP 15 MBA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

Tell me something about yourself

What motivates you to pursue a graduate business degree?

Why do you want to join this business school?

Why should we take you in?

Discuss your achievements as a leader

What are your strengths and weaknesses?

What aspects of your current job do you enjoy?

What are your immediate and long-term objectives?

How would an MBA help you advance in your career?

Are you a team player? Describe

What would your co-workers, supervisor, or friends say about you?

How do you make the most of your resources?

Have you applied to any other schools?

Describe a period when you had an inept manager and how you dealt with the situation

Do you have any concerns or inquiries about the school or program?

How to Write the GMAT Essay

Despite the Analytical Writing Assessment not contributing to your total GMAT score, it does play a subtle role in your admissions criteria.

“While AWA may not explicitly help your case, a low AWA score definitely acts as a deterrent, scoring less than 4 on the GMAT essay can damage your chances of admission to top business schools,” says Manan Kumar, of ENZ PREP.

Erika Väätäinen, an admissions consultant at mbaMission, recently broke down the importance of the GMAT essay and offered an organizational framework for applicants to follow.

BRAINSTORM

First and foremost, start by reading the essay prompt carefully. In many ways, the prompt will look and feel just like the Critical Reasoning arguments of the GMAT.

“The argument will most closely resemble Assumption Family arguments, so find the conclusion and make sure you understand how the author is trying to support their conclusion,” Väätäinen says. “Next, brainstorm any assumptions that you can think of and jot these down.”

After brainstorming, start articulating the flaws in the argument—pick two or three to form the basis of your essay.

“Any assumptions are automatically flaws, because the author has not established that those assumptions are, in fact, true,” Väätäinen says. “You may also think of other flaws along the way.”

FIRST PARAGRAPH

Your first paragraph should summarize the conclusion of the given argument in one to two sentences and contain your thesis.

“The thesis is typically one sentence and conveys to the reader your overall message or point for the essay that you wrote,” Väätäinen says. “For the argument essay, you can write most of your thesis sentence before you get to the test! You already know that the argument will contain flaws, and that you will be discussing how those flaws hurt the author’s conclusion. Guess what? That is always your thesis.”

BODY PARAGRAPHS

Dedicate each body paragraph to a flaw. In each paragraph, Väätäinen recommends including the following:

Introduce one flaw (Do not repeat the exact language from the prompt)

Explain why it is a flaw (JHow does this make the conclusion less likely to be true?)

Suggest ways to fix the flaw (you are fixing the flaw, not changing the conclusion; what could the author do to strengthen their argument?)

“For example, let us say that an argument claims that firing half of a company’s employees will help the company to reduce costs and therefore become more profitable,” Väätäinen says. “What is the conclusion, what supports that conclusion, and what assumptions is the author making?”

CONCLUSION PARAGRAPH

Using different words, your conclusion paragraph should restate your thesis, reacknowledge the other side, and briefly summarize how your examples support your thesis. Väätäinen recommends keeping your conclusion paragraph to three to four sentences max.

“Basically, the conclusion paragraph is not going to contain much new information,” Väätäinen says. “It is a conclusion; the major points should already have been made earlier in the essay. What you are doing now is tying everything together in one neat package.”

Late last year, investors flocked to Treasuries amid expectations of rate cuts by the Fed as early as the first quarter of this year. This surge in demand caused government bond prices to rebound sharply from 16-year lows. However, many investors are now reassessing their positions following robust U.S. jobs data and a cautious tone from the Fed, with the central bank recently warning that a strong economy could lead to inflationary pressures if rates are reduced prematurely. While investors still anticipate multiple rate cuts this year, there is now greater uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of the Fed's monetary easing measures.

That said, investors would do well to recall that the NASDAQ Composite experienced a sharp decline of over 33% in 2022 amid concerns of a recession. Even during the pandemic-induced volatility of 2020, characterized by surges in tech-heavy growth stocks, the index closed the year with an impressive gain of nearly 44%. It appears that this positive momentum is carrying into 2024, with many investors maintaining confidence in their tech holdings and anticipating further profitability as the year unfolds. The latest growth indicators suggest that the index is poised for another record-setting year in the market.

On February 1, Farzin Azarm from Mizuho Americas discussed current trends in the US tech sector and investors' continued focus on tech stocks during an appearance on CNBC. Azarm suggests that the persistent favoritism towards US tech stocks is leading to a disregard for stocks from other regions, particularly those from China. He posits that a significant shift in the US tech and AI sectors is necessary to redirect investment interest towards Chinese stocks. Azarm notes that investors, having already allocated substantial funds to pricey American stocks, are hesitant to further invest in similarly expensive companies.

Given the circumstances outlined above, it's no wonder that renowned companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remain top contenders as some of the best American stocks to invest in, both in the eyes of analysts and investors.

In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.

The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.

The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.

Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.

To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”

“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”

6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)

This trend represents about 5.1% of the total US workforce, and hence, highlights the financial strain caused by high inflation. Despite nominal wage growth, the average hourly earnings for all employees have declined by 2.89% since January 2021. As a result, households are grappling with a major increase in the cost of living, with expenses like food and shelter seeing high spikes. For instance, food prices have increased by 33.7% since the start of 2021, while shelter costs have risen by 18.7%. With inflation remaining well above the Federal Reserve's target, Americans are facing an ongoing struggle to manage their finances amid the economic challenges posed by increasing prices.

Owing to the rising inflation, individuals across the globe have been engaged in freelancing and thus, into remote work. In fact, the number of freelancers has been on the rise, with the US freelancing market alone valued at $1.2 trillion in 2020 with approximately 36% of the total workforce, which equates to nearly 59 million individuals. This indicates the increasing attractiveness of flexible work arrangements and the digital transformation in jobs. To read more, do check out our article about the best work-from-home jobs for 2023.

By Zeba Siddiqui

(Reuters) -Internet giant Google on Tuesday called out a series of surveillance software companies that it said were enabling the use of dangerous hacking tools, and urged the United States and its allies to do more to rein in the spyware industry.

Spyware firms often say their products are meant for the use of governments for national security. However, the technology has been repeatedly found to have been used to hack into the phones of civil society, political opposition and journalists in the last decade. The industry has faced increasing scrutiny since the Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware was found on the phones of various people globally, including human rights defenders.

In a report on Tuesday, Google researchers said that while NSO is better known, there are dozens of smaller firms helping the proliferation of spy technology for malicious uses.

The findings by Alphabet Inc's Google are significant because the company has some of the best visibility into hacking campaigns globally, given the vast breadth of its online offerings.

""Demand from government customers remains strong and our findings underscore the extent to which commercial spyware vendors have proliferated hacking and spyware capabilities that weaken the safety of the Internet for all,"" researchers from Google's TAG threat-hunting team said in the report.

""The private sector is now responsible for a significant portion of the most sophisticated tools we detect.""

The United States and several of its allies committed last year to work toward curbing the surveillance software industry, after at least 50 U.S. government employees in 10 countries were found to have been targeted by spyware.

The Google researchers named a roster of firms that offer a range of services to break into phones, and have been evolving to bypass the latest security measures by Apple and Google for their phone operating systems iOS and Android.

They include the Italian firms Cy4Gate and RCS Labs, Greek company Intellexa, and the lesser-known Italian company Negg Group and Spain's Variston.

Negg Group’s website says the company is focused on cybersecurity, but Google said its software was found to have been used to spy on people in Italy, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan.

Variston made software that infected user’s devices via the browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or iOS apps, Google said, adding that another company, Protected AE -- also known as Protect Electronic Systems -- used a similar targeting technique.

The five companies either did not respond to requests for comment, or were not reachable.

The Google report comes a day after the United States announced a new visa restriction policy for those it said were misusing commercial spyware, allowing the placing of restrictions on individuals believed to have been involved in the abuse of commercial spyware, as well as for those who facilitate such actions and benefit from it.

""Limiting spyware vendors' ability to operate in the U.S. helps to change the incentive structure which has allowed their continued growth,"" Google said in a statement.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) continue to be considered some of the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts and investors alike. These companies are some of the best long-term tech stocks to invest in and have been dubbed the best tech stocks to buy for several years, all due to their stellar performance. But they have been joined by many other notable names, which our list below will highlight.

Our Methodology

We have selected the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts by using a stock screener to identify American tech stocks and then shortlisting the top stocks based on their upside potential according to Wall Street analysts. The stocks are ranked from the lowest to the highest upside potential as of February 5. We have also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock. Some leading companies, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), had to be excluded from our list because of their low upside potential.

Upslope Capital Management mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global equity markets rebounded on Thursday on expectations that interest cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks were coming, though not as soon as hoped for, while Treasury yields slid again on concerns about regional U.S. banks.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday pushed back on market speculation that rates would be cut in March, sparking a sell-off on Wall Street that lingered into Thursday until investors turned their focus to corporate earnings.

MSCI's index of equity performance in 47 countries at first seesawed but later rose as investors looked ahead to results from megacap stars Apple, Amazon.com and Meta Platforms after the bell.

A number of investors already had discounted the narrative that many rate cuts were on the horizon, said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

GOOGL,2024-01-31,"In this article, we take a look at here is how billionaire Chris Hohn's hedge fund beat the market with 33% gain and his top 9 stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion of Hohn's investment philosophy, his fund's performance and go directly to Here is How Billionaire Chris Hohn's Hedge Fund Beat the Market with 33% Gain and His Top 5 Stock Picks.

Founded in 2003 by billionaire investor Chris Hohn, the TCI Fund Management was up 32.7% in 2023, recouping a significant chunk of the losses accrued in 2022. The hedge fund was down by about 18% in 2022 as the S&P 500 fell 19% at the height of a ferocious market sell-off triggered by a significant spike in inflation and a push by the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates.

TCI Fund Management had one of the best years in 2019 as it returned $8.4 billion worth of net gains, providing a 41% return against an average hedge fund return of 10.35%. It returned 14% at the height of the COVID 19 pandemic in 2020. Likewise, it outperformed the overall sector as equity hedge funds gained 6.65% on average in 2023 against its 32.7%, benefiting from solid gains in the technology sector.

Hohn founded the hedge fund with his ex-wife, Jamie Cooper Hohn, with the sole aim of transforming the lives of children and adolescents. Consequently, the hedge fund manager donates 50 basis points of the management fees to the fund to help fund various charitable initiatives. In addition, the fund also finances various causes, including climate, sexual & reproductive health, aimed at improving the health and lives of girls all over the world.

TCI Fund Management has been growing in strength since it bounced back from a 43% drawdown amid the global financial crisis in 2008. It has generated, on average, 18% in annualized gain since inception, more than double the return of the S&P 500 index over the same period. The gains have come on Hohn running mostly long only and a very concentrated global portfolio of stocks.

TCI Fund Management 's performance in 2023 affirmed Hohn's stock-picking skills that have always allowed him to outperform the overall market. The hedge fund has posted profits for 13 straight years through 2021. It only lost money when it went down by 18% in 2022 as its investments in Alphabet and Microsoft turned sour amid a broader sell-off in the tech sectors.

In 2023, it was a different ball game as TCI Fund Management benefited from its exposure to high-growth stocks that exploded at the height of the bull run. Its biggest holdings were all up by more than 25% for the year, helping propel TCI Fund Management to stellar gains in 2023.

The hedge fund also benefited from the diversification strategy that Hohn has always relied on to generate returns in the market. Over the years, Hohn has always emphasized investing in various industries, including manufacturers, consumer products companies, and even banks. While the services sector accounts for the biggest share of TCI Fund Management holdings, the fund is also heavily invested in technology and health care.

Chris Hohn

Hohn is also known for his relentless efforts in pushing companies to make strategic changes to improve performance and returns. He occasionally spearheads activist campaigns whenever he believes a stock is trading below its intrinsic value. One of his most recent activist campaigns was at Alphabet, where he penned a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai asking the executive to initiate structural changes in the push to cut back on expenses and reduce headcount.

It is still unclear whether Hohn’s activist campaign letter prompted Alphabet to embark on a restructuring drive. Concerned by soaring pressure amid artificial intelligence threats mostly spearheaded by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) took drastic changes that involved laying thousands of workers.

The tech giant also bolstered its investments in artificial intelligence, resulting in the launch of AI-powered chatbot Bard. Amid the efforts, Hohn also pushed Alphabet to consider decreasing salaries as one of the ways of clamping down on expenses as competition for talent in the industry has subsidized significantly.

Airbus is another company that has felt the full brunt of Hohn activists' campaigns. In February of last year, the billionaire investor wrote a letter urging the company to terminate ongoing negotiations over the purchase of a minority stake in Evidian.

With about $4.3 billion worth of stakes in Airbus, the billionaire reiterated the investment would only be value-destructive. While Airbus shrugged off the activist campaign and went ahead with the deal, it ultimately fell apart amid regulatory hurdles.

GOOGL,2024-01-31,"""What I learned at business school was that Silicon Valley was the center of the creation of the internet industry… It seemed crazy to go back to New York."" Kacher once told Forbes.

The Silicon Valley insights help guide Kacher’s long and short investment strategies. For example, he takes long positions in industry disruptors and shorts the incumbents. After learning that business travelers preferred ride-hailing services like Uber to traditional rental car services, Kacher went about shorting rental car stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) and made good money out of it.

Also, Kacher shorts auto parts stocks because he believes that the rise of ride-sharing and electric cars will reduce consumer demand for auto parts.

As with all other hedge funds, Kacher’s Light Street Capital has had its hits and misses. There are years that it has delivered outstanding returns and years when it has suffered overwhelming losses.

From 2010 through 2017, Light Street’s annualized net returns stood at 19.8%. In 2017, the fund delivered returns of 38.6%. In 2018, its returns improved to 53% in the first 10 months of the year.

But 2021 and 2022 turned out to be punishing years for Kacher. His hedge fund lost 26% in 2021 and things only got worse in 2022 when the fund lost 54%. In 2022, soaring inflation, Russia’s war with Ukraine and rising interest rates combined to hurt technology companies. That dealt a heavy blow to tech-focused hedge funds such as Light Street Capital.

Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital

But the fund made a strong comeback in 2023, returning 46%. In 2023, tech stocks benefited from AI excitement, which led to the blockbuster returns at Light Street Capital.

The AI theme is expected to continue impacting tech stocks in 2024. In a recent interview with CNBC, Glen Kacher spoke about AI being a multi-decade opportunity.

While there will no doubt be ups and downs, the hedge fund boss noted that AI presents a huge tailwind and opportunity for investors. He sees the AI impact on technology companies being as massive as the previous major technology shifts, such as the shift from PCs to networks or SaaS software.

Kacher believes that AI presents a massive opportunity for the leaders in the technology sector and that AI is an incredible opportunity for investors to deploy their capital behind.

As to the best way for investors to get exposure to AI opportunities, Kacher believes that semiconductor stocks present a good opportunity. He notes that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the chip companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI.

Software companies are also great opportunities, according to Kacher. The hedge fund boss said that Magnificent Seven companies are best-positioned to ride the AI trend. He noted that these are companies with customers, massive data and massive amounts of capital.

AI is going to be a big deal for the tech industry in 2024. In Davos, industry experts spoke about 2024 being a potentially big year for AI. They noted that 2023 was the year of discovery when AI proved its ability and that 2024 will be the year when focus will be on improving the technology’s reliability so that those adopting it can be more comfortable with it.

Apart from AI continuing to attract more money to the technology stocks, the economic outlook also looks promising for tech companies. The Fed appears to have succeeded in cooling off inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Technology companies tend to thrive in an environment of low interest rates as borrowing becomes cheap and obtaining capital becomes easy.

Amid the continuing AI excitement and growing optimism over economic outlook as inflation cools and the Fed contemplates rate cuts, stocks are soaring in 2024 with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in January.

In its latest 13F filing, Light Street Capital revealed large stakes in semiconductor stocks that are expected to benefit from AI-fueled demand. The filing also shows that the fund remains heavily invested in software companies that develop AI tools or stand to benefit from integrating AI systems into their operations.

With these details in mind, let’s take a look at the top 15 stocks in Glen Kacher’s Light Street Capital portfolio.

Our Methodology

Light Street Capital bounced back in 2023 after the rout of technology companies in 2022 wiped out some 70% of the firm’s assets. The hedge fund benefited from its long positions in some extensive tech stocks that exploded amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Consequently, we have analyzed the hedge fund 13F filings and settled on its top stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on Glen Kacher’s hedge fund’s holdings.

“Indie Semiconductor, Inc. is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of automotive semiconductors for advanced driver assistance systems and connected-car user experience and electrification applications. Shares fell during the quarter due to investor concerns that near-term automotive semiconductor demand will face headwinds because of excess inventory in the automotive semiconductor supply chain, combined with third quarter revenue guidance that slightly missed consensus expectations due to a customer slightly delaying the launch of a new vehicle model where indie had secured a design win (so delayed, not lost sales). As indie steadily ramps new product and design wins into production, we are confident the company will achieve its targeted model of profitability by year end, while effectively doubling revenues as it delivers on its $4.3 billion and growing strategic backlog. We believe indie has the potential to grow from its $200 million revenue run rate today to its targeted $500 million by 2025 and $1 billion by 2028. In the years ahead, indie should benefit as it develops differentiated, highly integrated, energy-efficient products, while the automotive semiconductor vertical remains highly attractive over the long term.”

Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”

“Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)– Cellebrite provides tools to law enforcement to extract data (evidence) from cell phones, analyze the data, and manage the data. Solving many crimes without their tools is inconceivable. They are mission critical. One of the best indicators of business quality is pricing power. The ability to raise price only comes with attributes such as high switching costs and a limited competitive landscape. Cellebrite benefits from both, but has not aggressively flexed their pricing power to date. After being acquired by private equity, the company’s competitor, Grayshift, has reportedly been raising prices by more than 30% on select products. Cellebrite is taking more of a velvet glove approach, offering newer products with more functionality at higher prices, e.g., their “Premium” offering, which offers additional features and is, in fact, “premium” but is also 40-50% more expensive. The combination of raising prices, introducing new products, and cross-selling analytics products should fuel growth for the next several years. Extracting data from devices and making sense of it is not going to get easier nor is it going to become less mission-critical. Law enforcement needs tools to fight crime, and Cellebrite is the leading “arms dealer” to collect and review data from mobile phones.

For their September quarter of 2023 shareholdings, 81 out of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors. Catherine D. Wood’s ARK Investment Management was one of the significant shareholder of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) with stakes worth $944.85 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Tsai Capital Corporation, an investment management firm, mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:

“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”

GOOGL,2024-01-31,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at theHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.

Charles Paquelet is an American hedge fund manager who founded Skylands Capital in 2004. Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:

''Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,"" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.

In 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital. The fund had $661 million under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. You will see some of the top names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the fund's portfolio as well as spot under-the-radar small-cap names which could explode in the future.

Charles Paquelet's Investment Philosophy

Skylands Capital's investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to ""extrapolate"" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who ""can anticipate change before it is obvious.""

Value or Growth?

Charles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.

""It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important,"" the fund's website says.

Methodology

For this article we scanned Skylands Capital's Q3'2023 portfolio and picked its top ten technology stock picks. Why do we pay attention to what hedge funds are doing? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

10. Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA)

Skylands Capital bought a new stake in entertainment and games company Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund's stake in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was valued at $1.3 million as of the end of September 2023.

In December, Jefferies said it believes the gaming industry will see a slowdown in 2024 as gamers become more selective and prudent with their purchases. Jefferies said at the time that even though Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was expected to post 2025 guidance below expectations, its upcoming games like Battlefield, Sims, Skate and new Star Wars titles will ""re-accelerate topline and drive margin expansion.""

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA).

9. Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT)

8. Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM)

Skylands Capital, as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, owns a $2.4 million stake in Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM). Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a new stock pick of the hedge fund.

Baron Growth Fund made the following comment about Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a leading mobile voice and data communications services vendor offering global coverage via satellite. Shares fell on second quarter earnings, growth modestly slower than expected. Investors were also concerned by a potential slowdown in Iridium’s voice and data segment following several years during which the segment benefited from price increases and competition displacements. We attribute the earnings miss to a one-time write off of a spare satellite. This will not impact the company’s long-term prospects. We also remain excited about the potential benefit from Iridium’s recent partnership with Qualcomm to allow satellite connectivity on its new Snapdragon chips. While Iridium has suggested the realization of the direct-to-device opportunity might take longer than some investors had hoped, we believe the collaboration will yield substantial revenue for the company over time. We also remain excited about the company’s capital allocation program, which should benefit shareholders in the years ahead.”

7. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,612,316

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top tech stock picks of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet since his hedge fund Skylands Capital has a $2.6 million stake in the ecommerce retailer which is also a part of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that have gained a lot amid the AI boom.

UBS recently published a list of quality stocks it believes could outperform in 2024. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was part of the list. UBS said in its note that these Buy-rated stocks are in ""30% top for quality, have positive earnings momentum, are not crowded -- have a crowding data score better than 0.1 -- and have reasonable value without overly high beta.""

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the most popular technology stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 286 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”

6. SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC)

“Our bottom contributors in Q3 were all from our long book, including HCA Healthcare and SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC). SS&C Technologies, a provider of software and services to investment firms, brokerages and other financial institutions, has faced slower organic growth in recent quarters as its business units have produced inconsistent results. Further, rising costs have crimped margins — issues we believe will eventually stabilize but which we are monitoring closely. However, we believe the market is overly pessimistic about the company’s ability to improve its organic growth rate and its margins and are maintaining our position.”

GOOGL,2024-01-31,"On the flip side, other stocks such as small cap stocks often do well when the economy is growing since it provides them with the potential to expand operations and increase sales.

Profit is an important indicator of a stock's financial health since it measures the money that is available for growth reinvesting, retained capital, or dividends if the company is a dividend paying stock. It also shows that financial managers have managed to manage debt and expenses to ensure investor payouts, and provides an analyst comfort that a firm should be able to handle any economic or market headwinds.

Some of the most profitable blue chip stocks on our list are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A). For more blue chip stocks, you can also check out 10 Top Rated Blue Chip Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are In Love With: January 2024.

GOOGL,2024-01-30,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company’s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.

The Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what’s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.

Looking Beyond Encouraging Demand Trends

The Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.

According to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled – a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.

There is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.

Apple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.

The AR/VR Market Has Room for Disruption

Empirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple’s success stems from the company’s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.

Today, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.

The relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.

Apple’s Scale Problem

Apple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.

The problem with Apple’s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.

Even if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple’s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.

The highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company’s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.

Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?

Apple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple’s prospects, but they’re currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here’s what some analysts have said about Apple.

On January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock’s price target from $208 to $225, citing the company’s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.

On January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank’s best investment ideas.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.

Last week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.

Overall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.

The Takeaway: Vision Pro is Exciting, Apple’s Valuation Is Not

Apple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple’s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.

GOOGL,2024-01-26,"Amazon.Com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced a significant expansion in Mississippi with a $10 billion investment by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to build two data center complexes, the most essential capital investment in the state’s history.

In collaboration with the Madison County Economic Development Authority, this project aims to create at least 1,000 new jobs and boost Mississippi’s tech sector and GDP.

Roger Wehner, AWS’s economic development director, highlighted the investment’s potential to generate well-paying jobs and new regional opportunities.

Recently, Amazon named John Felton as the new AWS CFO, succeeding Richard Puccio, to supervise Amazon’s cloud unit.

Amazon’s commitment to Mississippi extends beyond this project, with investments totaling $2.3 billion since 2010.

These include infrastructure projects, renewable energy initiatives like the state’s first utility-scale wind farm in Tunica County, and a Whole Foods Market location.

The wind farm alone will likely create nearly 300 jobs during peak construction and provide significant tax revenue.

Overall, Amazon’s presence in Mississippi has created 7,500 direct jobs and supports an additional 9,000 indirect jobs while aiding over 1,000 independent sellers in the state.

The company’s efforts focus on helping local jobs, economic growth, and education and enabling opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses.

Earlier this month, AWS shared plans to invest close to 2.3 trillion yen ($15.5 billion) in Japan between 2023 and 2027 to foster data centers and bolster business operations.

The investment in Japan will exceed the ₹1.056 trillion ($12.7 billion) AWS earmarked for India.

In the second quarter of 2023, Amazon held a dominant share of 32% compared to Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Azure’s 22%, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud’s 11%.

Price Action: AMZN shares are up 0.54% at $158.60 premarket on the last check Friday.

GOOGL,2024-01-26,"Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is implementing layoffs of close to 700 employees, about 1% of its 70,000-strong workforce, following a previous reduction of 10% or around 8,000 workers in 2023.

This move comes amid ongoing cost-cutting pressures from investors, including activist shareholders like Elliott Management, to drive its margins.

Despite these cuts, Salesforce still maintains 1,000 open positions, suggesting these layoffs are part of workforce adjustments rather than a significant strategic shift, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The company’s focus is on directing spending towards growth.

Last September, Salesforce also shared plans to hire nearly 3,300 new employees across various departments, focusing significantly on sales, engineering, and developing the company’s data cloud product.

These steps have contributed to a significant boost in its stock value, which increased by almost 80% over the last 12 months, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 37% rise.

Tech firms increasingly focus on artificial intelligence (AI), leading to a hiring surge in this area while other sectors face layoffs into 2024. Over 20,000 tech workers have been laid off so far in 2024, as reported by layoffs.

In January 2023, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google divulged plans to eliminate 12,000 positions, comprising 6% of its global employees.

According to Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, while companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google heavily invest in AI, they are cutting back in non-strategic areas, CNBC reports.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has informed employees of more impending job cuts as the company shifts its investments towards AI.

Alex Kantrowitz of Big Technology notes that in the current economic climate, Big Tech companies need to find cost-cutting measures to invest in the expensive AI sector, a trend other major tech firms are likely to follow.

In 2023, the tech sector let go of 141,516 employees in the first half of the year compared with about 6,000 a year ago.

German software company SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) announced the restructuring of about 8,000 roles to focus more on AI.",0.01845407196969697,0.4509232954545454,Neutral,0.9924144148826599,0.45239336776903294
GOOGL,2024-01-25,"Google parent Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is up on Thursday. It resolved a patent lawsuit on Wednesday involving AI technology, with the claim amounting to an extraordinary $1.67 billion.

Singular Computing, established by Massachusetts computer scientist Joseph Bates, initiated the lawsuit. The company accused Google of misusing its computer-processing solutions.

Google has also partnered with Hugging Face, a startup specializing in AI software, to host its platform on Google’s cloud computing network.

This collaboration will allow Hugging Face to offer its platform through Google Cloud, significantly expanding developers’ access to the startup’s AI tools.

The Hugging Face partnership will likely accelerate innovation by enabling more developers to create AI applications using Hugging Face’s resources and Google Cloud’s computing capabilities and specialized hardware, Bloomberg reports.

This agreement bolsters Google’s relationship with the open-source AI community, a sector increasingly competitive with significant tech companies in developing cost-effective AI models.

Hugging Face, a New York-based company founded in 2016, has gained popularity for sharing open-source AI models.

Through this partnership, developers using Hugging Face will benefit from the technological resources of Google Cloud.

Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue highlighted the partnership’s potential to enhance the capabilities of both Hugging Face users and Google Cloud customers.

Google’s involvement in Hugging Face’s recent funding round, valued at $4.5 billion, further solidifies its collaborative efforts in the AI field.

In 2023, Google committed close to $2 billion to AI startup Anthropic after reports of Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) decided to earmark $4 billion.

Google already integrated its Bard artificial intelligence chatbot with several popular products, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs.

Big tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google, remain aggressively invested in their AI ambitions. Analysts projected $1 trillion in AI-driven opportunities for companies like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) as they wholeheartedly splurge on AI technology.

GOOGL,2024-01-24,"The Magnificent Seven tech stocks, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), are again driving the stock market’s surge.

These tech giants, known for their stellar performance last year, have returned 4.4% this month, outperforming the S&P 500.

Investors are flocking to tech stocks, with approximately $4 billion poured into tech funds in the past two weeks, marking the most significant inflow since August, the Wall Street Journal reports.

In 2023, these seven stocks collectively doubled in value, adding a staggering $5.1 trillion to their market capitalization.

Among these tech giants, Nvidia is a critical player in the ongoing tech-driven rally.

The company’s success is closely linked to the surging demand for semiconductor chips, especially those used to power artificial intelligence (AI) programs.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), a significant supplier for semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, recently announced its expected 20% revenue growth for the year.

Analysts remained bullish on Nvidia, citing improving PCs, AI deep learning, and inferencing markets now with generative AI tailwinds, gaming trends, automotive, and data centers.

The Big Tech stocks remain invested in ramping up their AI capabilities. Analysts have voiced $1 trillion in AI-driven opportunity for Nvidia being the frontrunner in GPU and chip supply.

This growing demand is a critical factor in the resurgence of these tech stocks and the broader stock market.

While the Magnificent Seven tech stocks have been performing well, it’s important to note that their returns this year, although impressive, have not reached the levels seen in the previous January.

Despite the slightly more modest outlook, Wall Street analysts recommend these stocks, projecting an average return of 8.6% for the group over the next 12 months.

GOOGL,2024-01-22,"Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is under fire from employees past and present who think that the company's leadership lacks vision.

What Happened: Diane Hirsh Theriault, a software engineer at Google, criticized the tech giant’s leadership on LinkedIn earlier last week. Theriault asserted that the company lacks visionary leaders and has been conducting random layoffs for the past six to 12 months.

Theriault described Google’s leaders as “profoundly boring and glassy-eyed,” stating that the company hasn’t launched a successful executive-driven initiative in years.

The employee also criticized Google’s approach to product development, comparing it to the BogoSort algorithm, where elements are reordered randomly until they land in order.

According to the post, Google’s executives are trying to steer the company towards artificial intelligence (AI), but without a clear vision.

Meanwhile, layoffs continue across various departments, including engineering, sales, support, UX, product, data science, and SRE.

See Also: Ex-Googler Calls Out CEO Sundar Pichai’s ‘Lack Of Visionary Leadership,’ Says Company Morale At ‘An All-Time Low’

The employee also highlighted a growing sense of nihilism among the staff, with many choosing to just do their jobs until they are let go. The post ended with a lament for the loss of Google’s once magical work environment and the fear-driven atmosphere that has replaced it.

According to Equity Research Analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Justin Patterson, Google CEO Sundar Pichai's quest for ""durable cost savings"" might have harmed the company.

""While we expect layoffs will be more modest than 2022’s, we do believe Alphabet may have unintentionally harmed productivity by creating uncertainty over which roles will be affected,"" Patterson noted.

Why It Matters: This isn’t the first time Google’s leadership has been called into question. In November, former Google employee Ian “Hixie” Hickinson criticized Pichai for displaying a ""lack of visionary leadership"" and disinterest in maintaining the ethos of Google that made it a successful company.

He also stated that the employee morale at Google is at an all-time low and that therapists in the Bay Area would say that all Googlers are “unhappy” with the company.

GOOGL,2024-01-16,"Insider Ownership Of Oscar Health

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

We can report that insiders do own shares in Oscar Health, Inc.. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own US$66m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.

General Public Ownership

With a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Oscar Health. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 22%, private equity firms could influence the Oscar Health board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.

Public Company Ownership

Public companies currently own 6.2% of Oscar Health stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Oscar Health , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. You can also check out the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Under $10 here.

Cloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.

The growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.

Currently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.

Even with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.

The Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.

GOOGL,2024-06-25,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) is significantly expanding its operations in response to growing demand in the AI, 5G, server, and data center markets.

The company remains engaged in its geographical expansion while maintaining Taiwan as its base.

Acter Group Co, a semiconductor equipment and chemicals supplier, is accelerating its overseas expansion, primarily focusing on Japan and Southeast Asia to support these demands.

The expansion is a strategic response to geopolitical risks and the need for diversified manufacturing sites, Taipei Times reports.

Acter Group Co-President Wang Chun-sheng emphasized the company’s strategy to enhance its global footprint.

Acter’s significant clients include TSMC, United Microelectronics Co (NYSE:UMC), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia Corp, and Alphabet Inc’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

In addition to Asia, Acter is considering expansion projects in Mexico and the US, aiming to follow their clients’ geographical diversification.

Acter prioritizes Southeast Asia, Japan, and India for overseas expansion.

Last month, Acter’s subsidiary, Rayzher Industrial Co, established a branch in Kumamoto, Japan, to support TSMC’s fab operations.

Rayzher is also planning a second overseas site in Germany, where TSMC will likely build a new 12-inch fab through a joint venture.

Taiwan Semiconductor gained 68% in the last 12 months.

Investors can gain exposure to the semiconductor sector via First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:FTXL) and SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:XSD).

TSMC Stock Prediction For 2024

Equity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.

Some investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Taiwan Semiconductor, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Taiwan Semiconductor, the 200-day moving average sits at $120.13, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $170.84. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.

Traders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.

Price Action: TSM shares traded higher by 1.51% to $170.35 at the last check on Tuesday.

GOOGL,2024-06-21,"We recently published a list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.

UBS Global Wealth Management’s (GWM) recently published a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI “value chain,” estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.

UBS segments the AI market into three layers – Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem — infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments, Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.

Next up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.

The third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it’s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers — think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.

Key AI Predictions

The UBS report also made key “predictions” about the AI landscape. The firm’s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a “capex cycle” that could “inflate” the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects “monolithic players” and “AI foundries” prevailing in the near future.

Based on this report, let’s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 165

According to the latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain – enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.

Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”

Overall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Wealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.

FAANG: Stocks With Real Bite

When people talk about the FAANG stocks, they’re referring to five of the most prominent and traditionally high-performing tech and social media companies. Here’s what the acronym originally stood for, though now it’s a little outdated.

Facebook, now called Meta Platforms, with the ticker symbol META.

Apple, with the ticker symbol AAPL, which hasn’t changed since the company’s December 12, 1980, initial public offering.

Amazon, another globally recognized brand, with the ticker symbol AMZN.

Netflix, which still sports its original ticker symbol, NFLX.

Google, whose parent company is now Alphabet Inc., though it’s retained the ticker symbol GOOG.

Together, the FAANG stocks are often referenced for their consistently strong market performance, ongoing efforts to innovate and huge market capitalizations.

A Decade of Technological Development

In terms of how far and fast technology has developed, 2014 seems like a lot more than 10 years ago. The tech sector was still seen as one of the largest opportunities for growth and formed the backbone of many forward-thinking financial strategies. But even the most astute analysts would have been hard-pressed to predict how big these tech companies would become and the financial performance that has made them the titans they are today.

Historical FAANG Prices Compared With Where They Are Today

Here are the prices of each of the five FAANG stocks from 10 years ago and today.

If you had invested $5,000 equally in these five companies, for an investment of $1,000 each, those $1,000 investments would look something like the following.",0.19021317829457365,0.41679586563307497,Neutral,0.9998786449432373,0.4417033744022204
GOOGL,2024-06-14,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified briefly Friday at the federal financial conspiracy trial surrounding buzz-to-bust startup Ozy Media, countering founder Carlos Watson's alleged claims that the search giant once sought to buy Ozy.

Google did consider hiring Watson for a high-level news executive job in 2021 and putting $25 million into Ozy in something of a tradeoff for luring him away, Pichai told jurors.

“Mr. Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,"" he explained.

But “did you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?” prosecutor Dylan Stern asked.

“No,” replied Pichai, who heads Google and parent Alphabet Inc.

He said he had been introduced to Watson at a conference and then in a video interview for a possible Google job interacting with news outlets. Neither the hire nor the $25 million investment ultimately happened.

According to prosecutors, Watson later told another prospective investor that Pichai himself had extended a nine-figure offer to buy Ozy. The Mountain View, California-based company produced TV programs, podcasts and a music-and-ideas festival before falling apart in fall 2021 amid questions about whether it had flagrantly misrepresented its audience reach, deals and finances.

Ozy Media lawyer Shannon Frison said in an emailed statement Friday that it's “unequivocally untrue"" that Watson told anyone that Google had made a $600 million offer.

“He never had such a conversation with Google and never told any person that he did,” Frison said.

Watson and Ozy Media have pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit fraud. He has said that he built a robust and real company, didn't con anyone and is being singled out for prosecution when he made, at most, entrepreneurial “mistakes.”

Defense lawyers have blamed any misrepresentations on Ozy co-founder Samir Rao, saying he is falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison himself. Rao pleaded guilty to identity theft and conspiring to commit fraud, and he is awaiting sentencing.

He testified earlier in the trial that his “moral compass” got scrambled by ambition, desperation to keep the company going and “Carlos’ deep belief that failure was not an option and we had to do whatever it took.”

Among other deceit, Rao infamously posed as a YouTube executive — even using a phone app to disguise his voice — in order to champion Ozy to Goldman Sachs investment bankers on a February 2021 call.

“It was one of the most disturbing calls that I have ever been on in my career,” Goldman executive Hillel Moerman testified Friday, calling the episode “a surreal experience.”",-0.03224637681159421,0.5764492753623189,Neutral,0.9977400302886963,0.46614902492356225

The Unity Catalog will also include an OpenAPI specification, server, and clients, allowing enterprises to access and manage their data and AI assets without vendor lock-in.

This significant move by Databricks enables organizations to use the Unity Catalog with their preferred tools, including a vast ecosystem of Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg-compatible query engines, VentureBeat reports.

This comes shortly after Databricks’ competitor, Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW), introduced its open catalog implementation, Polaris Catalog, which will be open-sourced over the next 90 days. Snowflake stock is trading lower on Thursday.

The Unity Catalog’s open APIs ensure compatibility with major cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP, and Salesforce and compute engines such as Apache Spark, Presto, Trino, and others.

Snowflake is battling scrutiny after data violations affecting major clients like Santander Bank and Ticketmaster.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cybersecurity subsidiary Mandiant identified a threat campaign aimed at Snowflake customer database instances to steal data and extort victims.

GOOGL,2024-06-13,"We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 8th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Billionaire Israel Englander is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund’s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg’s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium’s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander’s imposition of “tight guardrails” to limit losses. To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.

The report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is “not a good idea.”

The FT report said Englander’s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022, 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.

For this article, we scanned Millennium Management’s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund’s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Billionaire Israel Englander’s Stake Value:$820,337,453

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is apparently in a no-holds-barred fight against competitors in the AI race that according to many threatened the bread and butter of Google its search business. However, many analysts believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is making a big turn and will continue to grow. Alex Kantrowitz, Big Technology founder, while talking to CNBC last month, said that the present for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is looking “real good” amid revenue growth, leadership’s harsh stance against those “making trouble” insider the company, dividends and buybacks.

Latest data analyzed by Bank of America shows that across all devices, Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) market search in search actually gained half a percentage point in May on a MoM basis. BofA analyst Justin Post said this shows Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Overviews are “aiding query growth and usage.”

Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating the company’s growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet’s 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.

Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”

Overall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey’s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visit Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024 to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc.

GOOGL,2024-06-12,"On Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) posted its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were below estimates. But, known for its database software, Oracle went all in to expand its cloud infrastructure unit to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights

For the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG’s estimate of $14.55 billion. Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle’s cloud unit is growing faster. The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion.

Adjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG’s estimate of $1.65. Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share.

Partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum

The aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to extend Azure Al to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl. Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google’s cloud infrastructure. As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges. Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle’s cloud database growth.

Outlook Shaped By The AI Hype

For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%.

Oracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024.

For the current fiscal year ending in May 2025, Catz expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads, adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand.

Shifting focus away from weak Q4 financials.

Meanwhile, Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st. Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won’t last forever.

GOOGL,2024-06-10,"GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) shares were trading higher in the premarket in a volatile Monday session, indicating a possible rebound.

Last Friday, the stock closed lower by 39% after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings ahead of its schedule and Roaring Kitty held a live stream.

While many were looking for an updated thesis on why Gill is investing heavily in GameStop once again, several investors were left with more questions after the stream.

The livestream ended up being disappointing for investors and the stock.

The video game retailer reported net sales of $881.8 million, down from $1.237 billion last year, lagging the analyst consensus estimate of $995.3 million.

GameStop reported an EPS loss of $(0.12), missing the analyst consensus estimate loss of $(0.09).

The quarterly net loss improved to $(32.3) million, down from $(50.5) million last year. GameStop also disclosed an at-the-market offering program, which permitted the sale of up to 75 million shares.

This added to the 45 million shares sold last month, which raised $933 million.

Last week, Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty, expressed his backing for CEO Ryan Cohen during an Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube livestream, the Financial Times reports.

The retailer’s core business has been declining, with store numbers shrinking by over a quarter in five years, but investment gains have mitigated some losses.

Gill confirmed his significant investment in GameStop and denied working with any third-party funder.

Investors can gain exposure to the GameStop stock via iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJH) and SPDR MidCap Trust Series I (NYSE:MDY).

Price Action: GME shares traded lower by 3.05% at $27.36 at the last check Monday.

DHOLERA, India /NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans a raft of business-friendly measures if he wins a third term this week, including pushing through regulations making it easier to hire and fire workers, according to two government officials familiar with the matter.

As part of an election pledge to transform India into a global manufacturing hub, Modi wants to offer subsidies for domestic production modelled on recent packages for semiconductor firms and electric vehicle makers, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to media.

The premier also plans to reduce import taxes on key inputs for locally-made goods, which have pushed up India's manufacturing costs, the officials said.

Modi's office and the labour and finance ministries did not respond to Reuters' questions.

Exit polls project that the right-wing coalition led by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will win a big majority when election results are announced on June 4.

Modi's reelection campaign was partly built on the promise of continued economic development. He's pitching India as an alternative for global firms diversifying their supply chains from China.

India is the world's fastest-growing major economy. But that includes both a booming tech sector and a struggling older economy that doesn't provide enough jobs for everyone else, said Josh Felman, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's office in India.

""What can be done now to provide employment - good jobs for these people - is manufacturing,"" Felman said.

India successfully lured suppliers for major U.S. corporations like Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. But less than 3% of global manufacturing takes place in the world's most populous country, compared to 24% for China, World Bank data shows.

The government plans to increase India's share of global manufacturing to 5% by 2030 and 10% by 2047, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. It did not provide specifics.

Reuters spoke to 15 people - including bureaucrats, representatives of major investors, economists and trade unionists - who identified three significant obstacles holding India back from manufacturing hub status: restrictive labour laws, challenges acquiring land, and a rigidly inefficient tariff regime.

INDIA'S PEARL RIVER DELTA?

When Modi was chief minister of his home state of Gujarat between 2001 and 2014, he dreamt up an investment zone in the Dholera region. Legislation creating the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR) was passed in 2009 and local authorities began acquiring land for it in 2013.

The plan, Modi said during a 2011 visit to a Chinese port, was to develop DSIR along the ""Shanghai model"".

Starting in the 1980s, China set up special economic zones along its southeastern coast that are widely credited for it becoming the world's factory floor.

Land reform was a precursor for China's manufacturing rise. Starting in the 1970s, Beijing separated ownership from usage rights, making it easier for investors to acquire industrial land, said Henry Gao, a Chinese trade expert at Singapore Management University (SMU).

Beijing's industrial zoning policies also made it easier for industries to set up in areas with ready access to materials and facilities, he said.

As prime minister, Modi has continued to stress the importance of industrial zones for India. In March, he described facilities under construction in DSIR as central to the creation of an Indian semi-conductor manufacturing hub.

Tata Group announced plans in January to build India's first semi-conductor fabrication plant there. During a visit in March, Reuters also saw construction activity for an upcoming cargo airport and promotional billboards set up by real-estate developers.

There were paved roads and a waterfront but little sign of bustling business.

DSIR hopes to attract more manufacturing companies by providing leases of up to 99 years on government-owned land, said Rahul Gupta, head of the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation.

Local officials have said that it took more than a decade to acquire land and award infrastructure contracts, but Gupta predicted there would be much more activity in about two to three years.

Outside such zones, industrial groups still have to undergo a ""very difficult process"" to acquire the large plots of land they need because title deeds are often unclear and holdings are fractured, said Richard Rossow of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.

In May, Foxconn - whose local investment was trumpeted as a major success by Modi - was met with protests by farmers in Karnataka state unhappy with the compensation they received from local authorities for giving up their land to the manufacturer, Indian media reported.

The Taiwanese company didn't return a request for comment.

LABOUR STRUGGLES

In much of India, firms with more than 100 employees need authorisation from state governments to hire and fire.

This prevents companies from adjusting their operations to meet demand, said Atul Gupta, partner at Bengalore law firm Trilegal.

The BJP-controlled parliament has passed legislation to raise the threshold before official approval to 300, but state authorities that must consent to the changes have stalled the move.

Modi hopes that a strong win on June 4th will give him the momentum and political capital to push through their opposition, the two government officials said.

""No government wants to come across as giving permission to a company to let go of their employees (but)...this is just used to drag out the closure or the terminations endlessly,"" said Gupta, who advocates labour reforms.

General Motors, for instance, decided to shut plants in Gujarat and neighboring Maharastra in 2017, citing low sales. But unions opposed the closures and GM only received judicial approval to exit India completely in January. The U.S. carmaker declined to comment.

To avoid such difficulties, companies end up using contract workers for extended periods, said labour lawyer Amrish Patel.

HSBC economists said that sweeping changes to labour regulations as well as land reforms are needed to sustain high growth.

In a note to investors last month, HSBC economist Pranjul Bhandari wrote that such reforms could allow India to grow at 7.5-8% over the next decade, creating a wealth of jobs.

But lawyer and union leader Sanjay Singhvi said nearly 60% of the workers who benefit from current labour laws would lose protections if the BJP's codes are implemented.

Praveen Chakravarty, a senior economics policy official with the main opposition Congress, told Reuters that labour law decisions should be left to the states. His party's manifesto calls for a review of the labour codes passed by parliament.

TARIFF LAND

Manufacturing costs in India are also elevated because of tariffs on imports, including components for high-end manufacturing.

To encourage smartphone production, Delhi cut import duties on components to 10%. But competitor Vietnam already levies a rate of between 0% and 5% on equivalent inputs, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association.

The average import tariff imposed by India on World Trade Organisation (WTO) members was 18.1%, compared to 7.5% for China, according to WTO data for 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available.

Customs processes are also significantly quicker and less burdensome in China, said Gao.

Imports can clear customs in China in about 20 hours, said the SMU professor. It takes between 44 and 85 hours in India, according to a 2023 government study.

Beijing has focused its efforts on being a key node in the supply chain rather than attempting to own the entire chain, leading to greater efficiencies.

For instance, products exported by China often include inputs from other Northeast Asian countries, said Christian de Guzman of Moody’s Ratings.

But Delhi ""wants to have the entire thing come onshore,"" Guzman said.

GOOGL,2024-06-02,"Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is concerned about some of OpenAI’s business dealings, particularly a potential agreement between OpenAI and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Satya Nadella recently met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to discuss this deal involving integrating OpenAI services into Apple products.

Nadella’s concerns stem from the potential impact on Microsoft’s product ambitions, the Business Insider reports.

Apple’s deal with OpenAI will solidify Altman’s control over the company after his brief ouster last fall.

Altman, who has pushed out rivals from the board, aims to replace Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as Apple’s search partner for Safari and build AI chip factories.

However, Microsoft, a significant investor in OpenAI, is concerned about the impact of the Apple deal on its own AI ambitions, according to the New York Post.

Apple considered both Google and OpenAI for this multi-billion-dollar deal.

If confirmed, this agreement would be a significant win for Altman, who has faced scrutiny from former employees and board members.

Tensions within OpenAI have reportedly been brewing since Altman’s brief ouster in November. An insider revealed to The Financial Times that Microsoft pressured OpenAI to prioritize commercial products, exacerbating existing tensions between executives.

Despite these challenges, OpenAI’s valuation has soared to $90 billion since launching ChatGPT.

Altman is considering converting OpenAI into a for-profit corporation to attract significant capital and expand its AI infrastructure.

OpenAI’s annual revenue crossed the $2 billion mark. The ChatGPT parent eyes doubling revenue by 2025.

Microsoft stock gained over 26% in the last 12 months. Apple gained 8%.

Price Actions: MSFT shares traded higher by 0.06% at $414.93 premarket at the last check Friday. AAPL is down 0.14% at $191.03.

Analyst Toshiya Hari raised the price target to $1100 from $1000 and reiterated the 'Buy' rating. In the research note, the analyst mentioned that the sustainable nature of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s growth suggests that the stock is trading at an attractive valuation.

The strong fundamentals suggest that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a good pick for risk-averse investors looking for solid long-term returns. Therefore, it's not surprising that the stock is one of the most popular among hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.

GOOGL,2024-05-30,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Google plans to invest $2 billion in Malaysia, developing its first data center and a Google Cloud hub in the latest big foray by a U.S. tech giant in the Southeast Asian country.

The news follows Microsoft's recent announcement that it would put $2.2 billion over the next four years into building Malaysia’s new cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hailed Google’s investment as a sign of faith in Malaysia’s governance and economy. Anwar said Thursday that the investment is expected to add $3.2 billion to the economy and create 26,500 jobs by 2030.

The investments are a coup for Anwar as he seeks to consolidate his strength against a strong Islamic opposition.

Google said in a statement that the new hubs will be developed at a business park in central Malaysia's Selangor state, to meet growing demand for cloud services and for artificial intelligence literacy programs for Malaysian students and educators.

Malaysia will be the 12th country to house a Google data center. The Malaysian Google Cloud hub — which will deliver services to large enterprises, startups and the public sector, will join 40 regions and 121 zones currently in operation around the world, it said.

“This investment builds on our partnership with the government of Malaysia to advance its ‘Cloud First Policy,’ including best-in-class cybersecurity standards,” said Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc.'s president and chief financial officer.

GOOGL,2024-05-27,"This means that we need to analyze individual quantum computing stocks to see how they have performed recently. Heading into the year's second half, investors have battled with high inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical tensions, turmoil in banking, and euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence since 2022.

Some quantum computing stocks that are commonly known are Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI), IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ), and D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS). Over the past five years, their shares have lost 89%, 24%, and 89%, respectively. Mind you though, this doesn't mean that quantum computing stocks never go up. For instance, take the example of IonQ. The firm listed its shares for trading in October after a merger, and between October 8th and November 19th, the stock soared by a whopping 233%. For comparison, Wall Street's AI darling NVIDIA's shares have gained 239% over the past twelve months.

So, the next question to ask is, what happened to this quantum computing stock? Well, part of the reason is a Goldman Sachs investment note that was released in November 2022. The note wondered when businesses would start adopting quantum computing into their operations, and whether the company's technology roadmap could align with this shift, as uncertainty persisted over ""which forms of quantum computer ultimately captures market share,"" according to analyst Toshiya Hari. After losing 14% in the wake of Hari's comments, the stock would proceed to bottom out over the new year in January, but its performance graph changes when we zoom into 2024's performance. April 2024 seems to have been the month for IonQ's shares as the stock is up by 17% since the 19th.

Larry Page Our Methodology

To make our list of the best quantum computing stocks, we first made a list of pure play quantum computing companies and those that make crucial products for the industry. These stocks were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had held shares according to the last round of 13F filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 222

Mega cap tech giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another key player in the global quantum computing market. Like IBM and Intel, it also designs its own quantum computing chips. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also seems to be interested in the practical side of quantum computing as it announced a $5 million prize in March 2024 for those who could think of the best use cases for the technology.

After compiling hedge fund regulatory filings for Q1 2024, Insider Monkey found Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake which was worth $6.9 billion.

Click to see 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.

Billionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management recently made headlines when his latest portfolio showed the 66-year-old owner of Carolina Panthers was piling into Chinese stocks while clearly cutting his exposure to mega-cap tech stocks which have already rewarded him heftily over the past several quarters, thanks to the AI-led rally. Tepper's bet on Chinese stocks comes at a time when many analysts are predicting a rebound of Chinese economy as the government begins to devise more rescue plans for the devastated property sector. The MSCI China index is up about 10% since the end of March.

David Tepper, who founded Appaloosa Management back in 1993, returned 20% last year, thanks to his huge stake in AI stocks. A cursory analysis of David Tepper, worth over $20 billion, shows that he was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper's instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he'd joined in 1985.

Tepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the mist of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:

“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”

However, the billionaire started decreasing his hold in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) significantly in 2021. In the first quarter, Appaloosa decreased its position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) by 10%. The fund still owns a $316 million stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).",0.17050925925925928,0.4100462962962963,Neutral,0.5290287137031555,0.502968643382583

On Wednesday, Amazon and Hugging Face announced a collaboration to enable this on Amazon Web Services (AWS) custom chip called Inferentia2, Reuters reports.

Valued at $4.5 billion, Hugging Face has become a key platform for AI researchers and developers to share chatbots and other AI software.

Amazon, Google’s Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) back Hugging Face, among others.

It is the primary destination for developers exploring open-source AI models such as Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 3.

“Efficiency is crucial to us – ensuring that as many people as possible can run models cost-effectively,” said Jeff Boudier, head of product and growth at Hugging Face.

AWS aims to attract more AI developers to use its cloud services for AI delivery. While Nvidia leads in training models, AWS claims its chips can operate those trained models – an inference process – at a lower cost over time.

Recent reports indicated that Matt Garman will take over as AWS CEO, succeeding Adam Selipsky, effective June 3.

During its latest quarterly results, Amazon announced that AWS became a $100-billion annual revenue run rate business.

AWS led the global cloud service market in the fourth quarter, accounting for 31% of total cloud spending.

Amazon analysts had highlighted the upside of AI chip development and diverse large language model offerings.

Amazon stock gained 59% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR Select Sector Fund – Consumer Discretionary (NYSE:XLY) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (NYSE:FDIS).

GOOGL,2024-05-17,"ChatGPT parent OpenAI has disbanded a team dedicated to ensuring the safety of potentially ultra-capable AI systems after the group’s leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever, departed.

The so-called superalignment team, established less than a year ago under Sutskever and Jan Leike, has been absorbed into broader research efforts across the company, Bloomberg reports.

This integration aims to maintain the focus on safety while addressing the recent high-profile exits that have stirred debates over the company’s speed versus safety in AI development.

Leike resigned following Sutskever’s departure, citing challenges such as insufficient resources and increasing difficulties in conducting crucial research.

Other team members, Leopold Aschenbrenner and Pavel Izmailov, have also left OpenAI.

John Schulman will lead OpenAI’s alignment work, and Jakub Pachocki, who will take over Sutskever’s role, has been appointed the new chief scientist.

In April, the United States and the United Kingdom agreed to address the concerns about AI safety.

The Biden Administration has actively engaged tech companies and banking firms to address AI dangers. AI giants like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) joined the White House’s AI safety initiative in February.

In 2023, the AI safety forum, the Frontier Model Forum, spearheaded by OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and AI startup Anthropic, appointed its first director and announced plans to establish an advisory board soon to guide its strategy. The forum also announced plans to develop a fund to support research into the technology.

GOOGL,2024-05-15,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), one of ASML Holding NV’s (NASDAQ:ASML) significant clients, has expressed concerns about the high costs of ASML’s new advanced chip machines.

At a technology symposium in Amsterdam, TSMC Senior Vice President Kevin Zhang remarked on the sticker price of the high-NA extreme ultraviolet system, which can imprint lines as thin as 8 nanometers and costs €350 million ($380 million) each, Bloomberg reports.

Despite appreciating the capabilities of the high-NA EUV, Zhang highlighted the economic considerations, stating that TSMC’s upcoming A16 node technology, due in late 2026, will continue to use older EUV technology instead of the new high-NA EUV machines.

He noted the rising costs of factory operations as a broader challenge for the industry, with increasing expenses for construction, tools, electricity, and raw materials.

Meanwhile, TSMC is looking to build its $11 billion European chip plant in Dresden, Germany, backed by EU and German support. The plant will produce 22-nm car chips and has plans for advanced tech expansions.

TSMC reported first-quarter revenue growth of 16.5% to $18.87 billion, surpassing the Street consensus estimate of $18.40 billion. Advanced technologies comprised 65% of TSMC’s total revenue.

Reportedly, big techs led by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) committed over $32 billion in AI infrastructure in the first quarter alone.

Price Actions: TSM shares are trading higher by 0.37% at $152.50 premarket at the last check on Wednesday. ASML shares traded higher by 0.23% at $917.11.

GOOGL,2024-05-15,"HONG KONG (AP) — YouTube has blocked access to videos of a protest song in Hong Kong, days after court approved an injunction banning the song in the city.

“Glory to Hong Kong” was an anthem of anti-government protests in 2019. YouTube said that it would comply with a removal order and block access to over 32 YouTube videos of the song that were deemed to be “prohibited publications” under the injunction.

Attempts to access the YouTube videos from Hong Kong on Wednesday showed that they were unavailable. A message showed saying that “This content is not available on this country domain due to a court order.”

In approving the government's application to ban the song, the court agreed it could be “weaponized” and used to incite secession.

“We are disappointed by the court’s decision but are complying with its removal order by blocking access to the listed videos for viewers in Hong Kong,” YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., said in an emailed statement.

“We’ll continue to consider our options for an appeal, to promote access to information,” the company said, adding that it shared the concerns of human rights organizations about the chilling effect the ban would have on free expression online.

Links to the 32 videos on YouTube will also not show up on Google Search for users in Hong Kong, according to YouTube.

George Chen, co-chair of digital practice at Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consultancy, said it is worth watching how aggressively Hong Kong authorities will be in ordering internet platforms to remove the song.

Chen, who was the former head of public policy for Greater China at Meta, said that if the government begins sending platforms hundreds of links to remove every day, that would likely undermine investor confidence in Hong Kong.

“That will hurt Hong Kong’s reputation as a leading financial center because we know how important a free flow of data and information means to a financial center,” he said. “So the government should be very careful and be aware of some unintended consequences that may impact its economic recovery and investors’ confidence.”

Internet and social media platforms such as YouTube typically have policies for removal requests from governments.

“Glory to Hong Kong” was often sung by demonstrators during massive anti-government protests in 2019. The song was later mistakenly played as the city’s anthem at international sporting events, instead of China’s “March of the Volunteers,” in mix-ups that upset city officials.

Authorities earlier arrested some residents who played the song in public under other offenses, such as playing a musical instrument in public without a permit, local media reported.

Critics have said prohibiting broadcast or distribution of the song further reduces freedom of expression since Beijing launched a crackdown in the former British colony following the 2019 protests. They have also warned the ban might disrupt the operation of tech giants and hurt the city’s appeal as a business center.

GOOGL,2024-05-06,"On May 1, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell categorically denied the resumption of the interest rate hike regime in his post-FOMC meeting statement. Moreover, the FOMC voted to ease the pace at which it is reducing bond holdings on the central bank’s gigantic balance sheet. The Fed started this program in June 2022, which was known as “quantitative tightening.” Its latest decision could be viewed as an incremental loosening of monetary policy.

A Goldilocks Environment?

A Goldilocks scenario is characterized as continuous economic growth but not as much a rapid pace to inflate the aggregate price level to such an extent that the central bank is compelled to tighten monetary policies.

The U.S. economy has cooled but is growing at a pace similar to that of the pre-pandemic level. The labor market shown the signs of crack but not at an alarming pace. The peak inflation rate is far behind us. Finally, there are no signs of any near-term recession. Consequently, this is a golden opportunity to enter U.S. stock markets.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.

Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL first-quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive. Also, the strength in YouTube favored the stock. Notably, a robust cloud division remains the key catalyst for GOOGL.

Expanding data centers will continue to bolster GOOGL’s presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. GOOGL’s deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.

Zacks Rank #1 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.1% and 30.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.5% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 12.6% from the last closing price of $167.24.

Netflix Inc. NFLX added 9.33 million paid subscribers globally in first-quarter 2024, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.

NFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.

Zacks Rank #1 Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 52.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 13.6% from the last closing price of $579.34.

Amazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. An expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN in gaining momentum among customers.

AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.

Zacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 56.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.7% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 16% from the last closing price of $186.21.

ServiceNow Inc. NOW has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation. NOW had 1933 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value at the end of the first quarter. NOW had eight deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV, and four deals of more than $10 million.

NOW closed 59 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV. The number of customers contributing more than $20 million or more grew 50% year over year. Generative AI deals continued to gain traction with record-breaking net new ACV for Pro Plus, making it the fastest-selling product in NOW’s history.

Zacks Rank #2 ServiceNow has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21.3% and 25.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.9% over the last 30 days. The average price target represents an increase of 19% from the last closing price of $716.65.

Boston Scientific Corp. BSX is seeing strength across target markets despite macroeconomic concerns, currency headwinds and related cost inflation. Strong worldwide demand for BSX’s GI and pulmonary treatment options, traction in Europe for its next generation WATCHMAN FLX, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers.

The Pain and Brain franchisees of BSX are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on the strong execution of core growth strategies. The EP arm received a strong boost on the FDA approval for FARAPULSE.

Zacks Rank #2 Boston Scientific has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12.3% and 13.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 30 days. The average price target represents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $72.85.

GOOGL,2024-04-30,"Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, ahead of its annual I/O developer conference in May, has confirmed layoffs across various vital teams such as Flutter, Dart, Python, and others, according to employee reports on social media.

The tech giant did not specify the teams, roles, or the number of individuals affected, TechCrunch reports.

Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert explained that these changes aim to align resources with the company’s most significant product priorities, improve efficiency, and reduce bureaucracy.

The layoffs are part of regular organizational adjustments and are not company-wide. Google encourages those affected to apply for other available positions within the company.

Despite the cuts, Google PM Kevin Moore assured the Flutter development community that they are still focused on upcoming projects, including new updates for Flutter at the I/O conference.

The company has also filed a WARN notice in California, indicating the layoff of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale.

In 2024, the tech sector surpassed last year’s layoff figures, with over 42,324 workers losing their jobs.

This comes after nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, continuing the industry’s trend of job cuts. Major companies, including Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Discord, Salesforce Inc (NASDAQ:CRM), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) have announced significant layoffs in January.

Several factors contribute to this seemingly contradictory situation. Firstly, the rapid advancement in AI technology requires substantial investments in new technologies, prompting companies to reallocate resources and reduce their workforce.

GOOG shares gained 56% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via IShares Global Comm Services ETF (NYSE:IXP) and The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC).

Price Action: GOOG shares traded lower by 0.07% at $167.78 on the last check Tuesday.

GOOGL,2024-04-30,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has aggressively recruited dozens of artificial intelligence experts from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, establishing a secretive AI laboratory in Zurich, Europe.

This move comes as the company intensifies its efforts to lead in new AI model and product development.

Apple, valued at $2.7 trillion, has been expanding its global AI and Machine Learning team by poaching many specialists from Google since hiring John Giannandrea as its top AI executive in 2018.

This includes at least 36 experts who have since joined Apple, the Financial Times reports.

In addition to its central AI teams in California and Seattle, Apple has grown its presence in Zurich, Switzerland. This expansion followed the acquisitions of two local AI startups, leading to the creation of the “Vision Lab” in Zurich.

The Zurich team has contributed to research on advanced AI models that merge text and visual inputs, which are crucial for products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple has advertised several generative AI positions in Zurich, maintaining a low profile in the area.

The company plans to showcase new generative AI features at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, potentially transforming the next iPhone into a more sophisticated voice-activated assistant with an enhanced Siri capable of interacting with all apps via voice control.

Apple analysts projected a slight increase in revenue for the March quarter and a significant guide-down for the June quarter compared to consensus, followed by a negative market reaction.

The critical event following the earnings will be Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where analysts anticipate new AI software features will be a significant highlight, with Apple experiencing a relief rally.

Analysts will be closely watching the March quarter for total revenue, focusing on revenue from China (where he expects iPhone shipments to be down 28% year-over-year) and growth in Services revenue, which he projects at 12.7% year-over-year.

Apple stock gained over 2% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK).

GOOGL,2024-04-27,"Alphabet Inc showcases robust revenue growth and a solid financial position.

Investments in AI and cloud computing signal future growth opportunities.

Regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges present ongoing threats.

Strategic acquisitions and partnerships could bolster market position.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has released its 10-Q filing on April 26, 2024, providing a detailed look into its financial performance and strategic positioning. The company continues to dominate the digital landscape with its comprehensive suite of internet services, advertising platforms, and technological innovations. A financial overview based on the latest SEC filing reveals a significant increase in revenues, from $69,787 million in the first quarter of 2023 to $80,539 million in the same period of 2024. Net income has also seen a substantial rise from $15,051 million to $23,662 million, indicating a strong financial trajectory. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect these financial highlights and delve into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape Alphabet Inc's current and future market standing.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with JNPR.

Strengths

Financial Performance and Brand Dominance: Alphabet Inc's recent financial results underscore its robust market position. The company's revenue surged by over 15% year-over-year, with net income jumping by a remarkable 57%. This financial prowess is underpinned by its dominant brand and diverse portfolio of services, including Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud. Alphabet's ability to consistently generate substantial income from operations, which increased from $17,415 million to $25,472 million, reflects its operational efficiency and the enduring appeal of its advertising platform, which remains the cornerstone of its revenue stream.

Innovation and Diversification: Alphabet Inc is not just resting on its laurels; the company is a beacon of innovation, particularly in AI and cloud computing. The 10-Q filing indicates a commitment to these areas, with expectations of increased capital expenditures to support growth, especially in AI products and services. This forward-thinking approach ensures Alphabet stays ahead in the technology race, diversifying its revenue streams beyond advertising and fortifying its long-term market position.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite its impressive financials, Alphabet Inc's heavy reliance on advertising dollars is a potential vulnerability. With over 85% of its revenue stemming from online ads, shifts in the advertising market or disruptions caused by ad-blocking technologies could significantly impact its bottom line. This dependence on a single revenue source, albeit a lucrative one, exposes Alphabet to market volatility and necessitates a strategic pivot towards more diversified income streams.

Regulatory and Legal Risks: Alphabet Inc's filing acknowledges the heightened regulatory scrutiny it faces, with ongoing legal matters and the possibility of substantial fines and penalties. These challenges not only pose a financial risk but also threaten to disrupt business practices and affect the company's reputation. As Alphabet navigates a complex global regulatory landscape, it must allocate resources judiciously to manage these risks effectively.

Opportunities

Expansion into Emerging Markets: Alphabet Inc's international performance is pivotal to its growth, with developing economies offering a vast untapped user base. As internet penetration deepens in these regions, Alphabet has the opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for digital services, potentially leading to significant revenue expansion and diversification.

Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: The company's robust balance sheet positions it well to pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships that can open new markets, enhance its product offerings, and consolidate its competitive edge. Alphabet's history of successful integrations, such as YouTube and Android, demonstrates its capability to leverage acquisitions for sustained growth and innovation.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The technology sector is characterized by rapid innovation and fierce competition. Alphabet Inc faces threats from existing tech giants and emerging startups that challenge its market share in core areas like advertising, search, and cloud services. Staying ahead requires continuous investment in R&D and a keen eye for evolving consumer preferences and technological trends.

Global Economic Uncertainty: Economic downturns and geopolitical tensions can lead to reduced advertising spending and consumer purchasing power, directly affecting Alphabet's revenue streams. The company's international operations also expose it to currency fluctuations and trade disputes, which can unpredictably impact financial performance.

In conclusion, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) presents a compelling case of a company with formidable strengths, including a solid financial foundation and a reputation for innovation. However, it must navigate the challenges of market dependence and regulatory pressures while seizing opportunities for international expansion and strategic acquisitions. The threats of competition and economic instability loom, but with prudent management and strategic foresight, Alphabet is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the digital age.

GOOGL,2024-04-26,"Markets rose Friday, boosted by earnings from Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., two of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, which both reported beats on revenue and earnings.

Microsoft's next quarter revenue outlook was higher than analyst expectations while Alphabet announced it would begin paying a $.20 a share dividend. Alphabet jumped more than 10% after the open and Microsoft rose over 2% in early trading Friday.

Rallies in the stocks boosted the broader markets, with the Nasdaq surging 2.2% and the S&P 500 adding about 1% midmorning. ETFs tracking the indexes gained similarly: SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust was 1.1% higher while QQQ, the Invesco QQQ Trust which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, popped 1.7%.

MAGS, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF which holds Mag 7 stocks in its fund soared more than 3%.

Microsoft and Alphabet's earnings surprises are helping improve the less-than-rosy picture painted earlier this earnings season by tech companies. Tech earnings have been in focus since last week as investors wondered if the megacap tech companies that have led the markets for so long would continue to do so in the future.

While Microsoft and Alphabet earnings delighted investors, Tesla Inc., Netflix Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. reported disappointing results that kept markets under pressure earlier in the week.

The Dow was little-changed, adding half a percentage point. DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust was up 0.2%.

The better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft and Alphabet helped investors look past inflation data released Friday. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March rose 0.3% for the month, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The monthly rise was in line with expectations from economists polled by Dow Jones. But the year-over-year rise of 2.7% (minus the volatile food and energy categories) highlighted how stubborn and persistent inflation has been.

The data came just a day after the Commerce Department released first quarter PCE figures, giving investors an advance preview of what was to come today. Thursday's advance reading of PCE torpedoed investor hopes that rate cuts were coming anytime soon.

PCE remains the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, and is a key piece of information for policy meetings about rate cuts. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady next week at the FOMC meeting, but questions still remain on when investors—and the economy—can anticipate relief from a high interest rate environment.",0.16967741935483877,0.4848924731182795,Positive,0.9999046325683594,0.45316158890010577

GOOGL,2024-04-25,"Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. on Thursday released a quarterly report showing it’s still reaping double-digit revenue gains from its digital advertising empire while sowing potentially lucrative new ground in artificial intelligence.

The results for the first three months of the year provided the latest evidence that Google has regained its momentum after an unprecedented downturn in 2022 coming out of the pandemic.

Alphabet punctuated its renewed vigor by also disclosing plans to begin paying shareholders a quarterly dividend for the first time since since Google went public 20 years ago. It’s something that two older technology powerhouses, Microsoft and Apple, have been doing for years. Alphabet's quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share will be paid June 17.

Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro praised the decision to pay a dividend as “a breath of fresh air for the tech market” that should also make investors more likely to support the increased amounts that Google will likely need to spend on developing AI products that could take years to pay off.

In the January-March period, Alphabet’s revenue rose 15% from the same time last year to $80.54 billion, which surpassed the projections of analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth for the Mountain View, California, company.

Alphabet earned $23.66 billion, or $1.89 per share, a 57% increase from last year's comparable quarter. The earnings per share also eclipsed the analyst estimates that steer investors.

“We are incredibly well set up, given the innovation path we are on,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday conference call.

The company's stock price soared by nearly 13% in Thursday's extended trading after the news came out. That reaction was a stark contrast to how investors responded to a report covering the same quarter from Facebook's parent. Meta Platforms also reported a surge in ad revenue but provided a disappointing outlook for the April-June period, while also warning its profits would be squeezed by increased spending on AI technology.

If Alphabet's shares move in a similar trajectory during Friday's regular trading session, the stock will hit a new all-time high that will push the company's market value above $2 trillion.

As has been the case since throughout the company's history, most of the money came in through a digital advertising network anchored by Google’s dominant search engine. Google’s ad revenue totaled $61.66 billion in the first quarter, up 13% from last year.

Despite the ongoing success, Google is facing dual threats that could threaten its future growth.

The U.S. Department of Justice is taking aim at its search engine a lawsuit alleging the company has abused its power by negotiating lucrative deals with Apple and other companies to give it an unfair advantage over potential rivals, stifling innovation as well as competition.

After a two-month trial last fall, the closing arguments in the biggest U.S. antitrust case in a quarter are scheduled to unfold next week and a federal judge is expected to rule whether Google has been breaking the law by the end of this year.

People also may not need to rely as much on Google’s search information to answer their questions and find other information as the artificial intelligence technology that Google, Microsoft and other industry stalwarts are building becomes more sophisticated. If AI gradually supplants the role that Google’s search engine has filled for the past quarter century, Alphabet’s ad sales also could dwindle.

For now, AI is helping to fuel rapid growth in Google’s cloud computing division, which saw its first-quarter revenue climb 28% from last year to $9.57 billion.

But the cloud division also has become a tinder box for Google management as dozens of employees have staged protests over a $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government that includes AI technology as part of Project Nimbus.

The protesting employees believe Project Nimbus is being lethally deployed by the Israeli military in the Gaza war — a contention Google has denied. The divisive issue came to head earlier this month during an employee sit-in at Google offices in Sunnyvale, California, and New York that resulted in more than 50 workers being fired.

Alphabet ended March with nearly 181,000 employees, a decrease of nearly 10,000 workers from the previous year. Management has cycled through several rounds of mass layoffs to help boost profits while Google ramps up its spending on AI technology.",0.07823484848484848,0.42467599067599054,Positive,0.9986159801483154,0.4331602030843449

GOOGL,2024-04-23,"Markets were in the green Tuesday as earnings season kicked into high gear, giving investors what they needed to help snap a losing streak in the S&P 500.

Companies are largely reporting earnings and sales that top forecasts, boosting investors' enthusiasm. Among the 14% of the S&P 500 having reported results by last week's end, 74% said they beat earnings expectations and 58% reported revenue beats, according to data from FactSet.

SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust jumped more than 1% after the open on Tuesday while DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust popped more than half of a percentage point.

All eyes are on tech earnings—particularly from the 'Magnificent Seven'—this week as Tesla Inc. gets ready to report earnings after the bell today. Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also on deck to report quarterly earnings this week.

QQQ, the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust soared 1.5% after the open on Tuesday. MAGS, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF which holds the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks rose roughly 1.6%.

Investors have been anxious for results from the Mag 7, looking for signs that the companies won't be able to sustain the levels of growth that have surpassed the broader market.

Year to date, MAGS has jumped more than 9%, and is roughly 48% higher than last year. In contrast, the S&P 500 has only risen 5% since the beginning of the year and 21% since last year.

Top gainers on Tuesday included NVDX, the T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF, and NVDL, the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF. Both ETFs jumped 5% and 7% respectively as investors geared up for earnings from the Mag 7. Investors will have to wait another month before NVIDIA reports.

CONL, the GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily ETF saw the biggest pop Tuesday, rising over 9% before paring some gains. The pop in the leveraged ETF which tracks Coinbase stock comes just days after the bitcoin halving, an event where the reward for bitcoin miners is halved, contributing to scarcity of the digital asset.

PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) led Monday’s rally among the Nasdaq 100 stocks by rallying over 9%, followed by Nvidia Corp.

Last week marked the Nasdaq 100 Index’s largest weekly drop in over 17 months, dragging the index to its longest losing streak since December 2022.

UBS Cautions In Tech Sector

UBS Group AG's chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub has advised caution on tech stocks.

As reported by Bloomberg, UBS downgraded its stance on the ‘Big 6’ technology giants—Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia Corp.— from Overweight to Neutral amid slowing earnings momentum.

Golub suggests that the downturn in tech earnings momentum will be driven by wider cyclical challenges, not by worries about valuations or the industry's prospects in artificial intelligence.

GOOGL,2024-04-09,"Uber Technologies, Inc’s (NYSE:UBER) Uber Eats is introducing a TikTok-style short-form video feature to enhance food discovery and enable restaurants to highlight their offerings more vividly.

This feature, which is currently undergoing testing in New York, San Francisco, and Toronto, represents Uber Eats’ foray into the burgeoning realm of short-form video content, aligning with a trend popularized by platforms like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Instagram, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), and recently Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) LinkedIn.

The feature showcases videos in a swipeable format, visible in carousels throughout the app, including the home screen, TechCrunch reports.

These videos aim to give users a closer look at food preparation, textures, portion sizes, and dish compositions, ultimately boosting consumer confidence in trying new dishes.

Notably, the content is offered to users based on the proximity of the restaurants, ensuring relevance and delivery feasibility.

Uber Eats’ approach differentiates from typical advertising; it doesn’t charge merchants for these video placements, offering a unique platform for restaurants to connect directly with potential customers.

This move is particularly significant as many restaurants leverage social media to attract new patrons and showcase their culinary creations.

Introducing this feature into the Uber Eats app aims to streamline the discovery process and encourage users to seek culinary inspiration within the app itself.

Uber Eats is also enhancing its support for merchants by revamping the Uber Eats Manager software with personalized growth recommendations and preparing to launch a new app for restaurant managers to facilitate on-the-go business management.

Prior reports indicated Microsoft’s LinkedIn testing a TikTok-like short-form video feed enabling users to interact with vertical short videos by liking, commenting, and sharing. This move by LinkedIn focuses on career-oriented and professional content.

Reports also suggested that Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) explore full-length music videos to appeal to the Gen Z audience. Meta expanded its short video offerings with the global launch of “Reels” in February 2022, while Google reported in June 2022 that YouTube “Shorts” had garnered over 1.5 billion logged-in monthly viewers. Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also entered the fray in August 2022, trialing a TikTok-like photo and video feed within its shopping app to facilitate product discovery.

Uber stock gained over 136% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSE:FPX) and Global X Millennial Consumer ETF (NASDAQ:MILN).

GOOGL,2024-04-08,"Have you been investing in FAANG stocks or even the “Magnificent 7,” which is a collection of tech-focused U.S.-based stocks? In 2013, four tech stocks stood out, earning the collective name, “FANG.” In 2017, the acronym expanded to encompass Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.

In 2023, the Magnificent 7 moniker emerged to describe an expanded group of tech stocks: Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Apple, Alphabet Inc. (formerly Google), Nvidia Corp., and Tesla.

But there’s another name savvy investors should know: GRANOLAS. These stocks don’t (necessarily) have anything to do with the crunchy treat preferred by hikers and healthy snack enthusiasts. Rather, they are 11 European-based companies that represent a broad cross-section of the market, ranging from luxury brands to biopharmaceutical companies.

In spite of being international brands, many are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet, they are not correlated strongly with the S&P 500, according to SeekingAlpha.com.

The stocks in the category are: GSK, Roche, ASML, Nestle, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, L’Oreal, LVMH, AstraZeneca, SAP, and Sanofi.

Today’s investors are finding multiple reasons to diversify their holdings into the GRANOLAS stocks.

GRANOLAS Stocks Have Outperformed the Market Since June 2022

This diverse collection of stocks has delivered 60% of the gains in the European stock market in the past year, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, and have outperformed the FAANG stocks for the past two years, Morningstar.com reported.

Plus, most of the stocks on the list deliver dividends of 2% to 2.5%.

They Provide Diversification

While tech stocks tend to fare well in the U.S., a portfolio made up of FAANG stocks doesn’t provide much diversification. On the other hand, the GRANOLAS stocks represent sectors ranging from consumer goods to fashion, technology and healthcare.

They also aren’t tied to the S&P 500 or Nasdaq index. If the bulk of your portfolio is filled with U.S.-based stocks, adding some shares of even a handful of the GRANOLAS could serve you well.

Because of the diversity of the companies on the list, the collection also shows less volatility than the Magnificent 7. “The realized volatility of the GRANOLAS is on average 2x lower than for the Magnificent 7,” Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer recently told SeekingAlpha.com.",0.23180465367965367,0.40685876623376627,Neutral,0.9984105825424194,0.4731705917329517

Cloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.

The growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.

Currently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.

Even with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.

The Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region.
