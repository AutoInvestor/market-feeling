Our Methodology

To select stocks for this list, we scoured the top stock picks as recommended by prominent financial websites like The Motley Fool, Forbes, Kiplinger, Investopedia, Morningstar, Zacks, Market Watch, and Business Insider. The top twenty consensus picks were then selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”

In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

“Among our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to like Pfizer for its diversified business, strong cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet, and solid leadership under a quality CEO.”

AAPL,2024-03-27,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly lower during Tuesday’s session.

MacRumors has reported that Apple is potentially introducing a “custom routes” feature in iOS 18. The discovery was made through a review of code associated with Apple Maps.

This feature will allow users to enter their chosen navigation paths, marking a significant expansion from the current pre-selected routes.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.57%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents per share (96 cents a year).

So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,060,688 or around 6,250 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $212,138 or around 1,250 shares.

Read This: Top 3 Energy Stocks That May Keep You Up At Night In Q1

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.96 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple were up 1.5% to $172.38 at the time of publication Wednesday.

AAPL,2024-03-21,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) recently acquired DarwinAI, an artificial intelligence (AI) visual quality assurance startup that provides an end-to-end solution for improving product quality while increasing production efficiency.

Founded in 2017 by Alexander Wong, Canada's research chair in AI, DarwinAI has garnered significant attention, raising over $17 million from investors including Honeywell Ventures and BDC Venture Capital.

Darwin AI's patented Explainable AI (XAI) platform has been adopted by numerous Fortune 500 companies. It integrates AI they can trust and results they can see. Wong led the development of the company's XAI platform, according to its LinkedIn page.

Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.

Apple’s acquisition of DarwinAI aligns with its longstanding practice of discreetly assimilating innovative technology firms into its ecosystem. When questioned by Bloomberg, Apple maintained its characteristic silence regarding its plans, citing a standard response employed across previous acquisitions: ""[Apple] buys smaller technology companies from time to time but doesn't discuss its plans.""

The tech giant’s recent unveiling of the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air hints at its ambitions in the AI sphere. Marketed as the “world’s best consumer laptop for AI,” the MacBook Air boasts a robust ecosystem of AI-powered applications. From AI Math Assistance in Goodnotes 6 to image enhancement in Pixelmator Pro, Apple emphasizes the device’s capacity to leverage AI functionalities seamlessly.

""Combined with the unified memory architecture of Apple silicon, MacBook Air can also run optimized AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models for image generation locally with great performance,"" according to Apple's announcement.

Trending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

Last December, Apple researchers shared advancements in local AI processing. Their paper “LLM in a Flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited Memory” showcases innovations enabling the efficient execution of complex language models directly on user devices.

""Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory,"" according to the paper.

These developments suggest Apple’s covert efforts toward creating a first-of-its-kind device capable of executing AI applications natively on hardware. By circumventing traditional server-based AI processing, Apple seeks to redefine the landscape of consumer technology with unparalleled performance and privacy assurances.

In the race to lead the AI revolution, Apple’s clandestine maneuvers may position it as the frontrunner, poised to deliver AI-powered experiences directly into the hands of consumers.

AAPL,2024-03-18,"American Express

The GF Value chart shows American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) to be fairly valued after the recent surge of over 58% from its October 2023 lows. American Express is a great company that Buffett has owned for decades. Its ROIC consistently exceeds its WACC.

Founded in 1850, American Express is known principally for its charge cards but also extends credit and provides a suite of related services to businesses and merchants. The company is positioned at the higher end of the card business. Despite the competitive nature of the industry, it has averaged about 10% earnings per share growth over many years, through above-average revenue growth and ongoing share buybacks.

Overall, I think American Express is a weak buy if you do not already own it. If you own it, I think it is best to wait for a more opportunistic entry point to buy more. It is a proven compounder of shareholder capital and though right now its not a bargain, buying it now is unlikely to cause regret in the future. However, be aware that the best opportunity to buy American Express happens when the fear of a recession is in the air like last year. With a booming economy like at present, American Express is on the expensive side. Berkshire owns more than 20% of its stock.

Buffett said, ""The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""

Occidental Petroleum

Berkshire owns 27.80% of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) shares as well as holds options to increase its stake further, but Buffett emphasized that he has no desire to own the company outright. The guru likes Occidental's vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of the latter technique has yet to be proven. However, clearly it will be needed in the future due to the inevitability of climate change and societal pressure to do something about it. Both of these activities, he said, are very much in the country's interest, giving the investment a patriotic flavor. Buffett likes the fact that Occidental's holdings are in the U.S. (thus safe from a geopolitical turbulence) and very much needed to maintain U.S. energy independence from foreign oil, which he sees as a risk to the country. Thus, his holdings in Occidental somewhat of a hedge against global conflict and turbulence.

Occidental looks modestly overvalued according to the GF Value Line. However, I think we should look at the stock from the lens Buffett is using that it is a domestic oil and gas major, and thus much safer than other large multinational oil and gas companies with comparable reserves outside the U.S. Further, like all oil and gas companies, it is very cyclical.

Buffett is a multibillionaire and is not bothered by volatility. However, most investors are not multibillionaires, so factor that in. All in all, I would wait for a better entry point.

Japanese holdings

Berkshire currently holds approximately 9% ownership in each of five Japanese companies. Buffett said in his letter that Berkshire has made a commitment to these companies that it will not acquire shares exceeding a 9.90% stake. The total cost of these holdings amounts to 1.60 trillion yen ($10.75 billion), while the year-end market value stands at 2.90 trillion yen. However, due to the yen's recent weakening, Berkshire's unrealized gain in dollars reached 61%, equivalent to $8 billion.

These companies are often referred to as Sogo-Shosha, which translates to ""general trading companies,"" and form a crucial part of the Japanese economy. However, they have greatly evolved from their trading roots and are now conglomerates of many trading, real estate and industrial businesses.

The first is Itochu Corp. (TSE:8001), a diversified conglomerate with interests spanning various sectors. Historically, it played a crucial role in importing energy, minerals and food into Japan. Today, its portfolio extends beyond trade activities to include logistics, real estate, frozen foods and even investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy.

Next is Marubeni Corp. (TSE:8002), another significant player in Japan's trading landscape. Like its peers, it has a diverse portfolio, including energy, agriculture and infrastructure. The company has adapted to changing market dynamics and expanded into non-trade areas such as real estate and aerospace.

Third, Mitsubishi Corp. (TSE:8058) has a rich history and has been instrumental in Japan's economic development. Traditionally, it focused on importing raw materials and exporting finished products. Today, the company's interests span various industries, including automotive, machinery and finance. It has also ventured into newer areas like EVs and renewable energy.

Mitsui & Co. Ltd. (TSE:8031) is one of the oldest sogo-shosha companies, with its roots tracing back to the Edo period. Over time, it has diversified its business lines, including investments in infrastructure, chemicals and health care. Mitsui's very long-term approach aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy.

Last but not least is Sumitomo Corp. (TSE:8053). It has a storied history dating back centuries. The company has been involved in copper mining, banking and trade. In recent years, Sumitomo has expanded into diverse sectors, such as real estate, logistics and telecommunications. Its focus on value and cash flow resonates with Buffett's investment principles.

The table below provides a snapshot of these companies basic fundamentals:

Since Buffett purchased the five companies about three years ago, they are up substantially in yen terms and even more in U.S. dollar terms as the yen has weakened. The following chart shows the price appreciation over the last three years.

While the five companies may not be household names globally, they play critical roles in Japan's economic landscape, which is similar to the role Berkshire plays in the U.S. Buffett's interest in these Japanese companies reflects their stability, diversified portfolios and long-term vision. He appreciates their similarities to Berkshire Hathaway, emphasizing value and understanding the businesses they operate.

Buffett said in his letter that because he cannot accurately forecast major currency market prices, Berkshire had financed a significant portion of its Japanese stock position using the proceeds from 1.30 trillion yen in bond sales. This debt issue has been well-received in Japan, and Berkshire likely holds more yen-denominated debt than any other American company. The weakened yen since then has resulted in a year-end gain of $1.90 billion for Berkshire, which, in accordance with GAAP rules, has been recognized in income over the 2020 to 2023 period. Thus, not only have the stock prices of the Japanese companies gone up substantially, but the debt Berkshire took on has diminished in U.S. dollar terms, resulting in a one-two punch in favor of Berkshire.

Buffett said in his letter that all five Japanese companies adhere to shareholder-friendly policies that surpass typical U.S. practices. Since Berkshire initiated its purchases, each of these companies has reduced their outstanding shares at attractive prices. Additionally, he says, their management teams exhibit ""less aggressiveness"" regarding compensating themselves compared to U.S. norms. Furthermore, each allocates only about one-third of its earnings to dividends, retaining substantial sums for business expansion and share repurchases. Like Berkshire, these companies are cautious about issuing new shares. From the tone of the letter, it looks like Buffett is really pleased with his ownership of the Japanese sogo-soshas and are companies he intends to hold indefinitely.

Other potential ""forever"" stocks

Buffett had surprisingly little to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his letter, given the extremely large part of Berkshire's portfolio invested in the stock. Apple now constitutes over 50% of Berkshire's non-controlled equity investment portfolio. It own 5.86% of Apple's outstanding shares.

The tech giant looks fairly valued on the GF Value Line. I don't think we can go wrong with Apple at the present time given its dominance in mobile tech and wide competitive moat.

Another stock is Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), which is Buffett's second-highest conviction stock after Apple and over 10% of his portfolio is in it. Berkshire owns about 13% of the bank's outstanding stock. It is also in fairly valued territory.

Conclusion

So that's it folks. These are Buffett's ""indefinite hold"" or ""close enough to forever"" stocks gleaned from his latest letter. At present, I think only Coca-Cola is a clear buy and the rest are weak buys. I like Apple and if it comes down a bit more, I may take the plunge.

Buffett's Japanese investments are very interesting, but I would rather hold them indirectly through my ownership of Berkshire stock to avoid the foreign exchange risk. The purchase of the five conglomerates was a master stroke. It is interesting to note that while Buffett has been building up his Japanese exposure, he has been reducing his Chinese and Taiwanese exposure. He has been selling down his BYD (SZSE:002594) position and has exited his Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) position. While he did not disclose a reason, I think it may be because of geopolitical concerns.

The guru's approach is pretty much safety first and very long-term thinking. Watching his portfolio is like watching paint dry. Like he says, the first rule of investing is not to lose money and the second rule is to see the first rule. It is very interesting to see this philosophy in action with his biggest holdings.",0.1488588137190621,0.425352290911297,Positive,0.9962446093559264,0.506413012481099
AAPL,2024-03-17,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 fastest growing AI stocks to invest in now. To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now.

Tech: A High-Growth Sector

If you're looking for high growth stocks to invest in, the tech sector is one of the best places to start. Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be exceptional additions to any growth portfolios as this revolutionary technology continues to expand and grow to bigger heights than ever seen before. However, the fact that AI is an exciting place to invest in right now does not automatically mean that every AI stock in the market is a good growth pick for investors. Resultantly, it's important to ensure that investors carefully pick out the AI stocks that can actually deliver on their promises of growth instead of the ones that can't.

On March 15, Eric Lynch, the Portfolio Manager at Scharf Investments, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss this dilemma in the AI space where investors may not know which businesses can actually grow their earnings. Here's what he had to say:

""We're at a kind of 'where's the beef?' moment for AI, where all the promises need to be delivered this year. If you look at investors' reactions to several AI stories in the past week, you know Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Oracle, and most recently with Adobe yesterday, what you're seeing is a reaction to slower growth than expected.""

Winners in Artificial Intelligence in 2024

According to Lynch, many AI companies today are lagging behind on their promises and cannot perform on par with the expectations leveled at them. As a result, it is becoming ever more important to separate the winners from the losers in this space. Lynch noted the following on which companies he sees as winners in AI:

""Obviously the chipmakers and the hyperscalers, we've seen that in the stock prices, NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, and most recently, Oracle. Oracle is really guiding for 50% infrastructure cloud growth going forward, because its use case was really generative AI, that it needed for its superior tech stack. So, these names are really benefitting.""

These ""winning"" AI stocks, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), are also among the top high growth stocks in the tech and AI sector today and have exciting developments brewing in 2024. For instance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has its GTC Conference coming soon this March, where CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote on what to expect from the company this year. Stifel's equity research analyst, Ruben Roy, joined CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on March 15 to discuss what to expect from the keynote. Here's what he said:

""I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion on the product roadmap - NVIDIA has increased the cadence at which they bring new products to the market, I think that's really interesting. I think there's gonna be a discussion around the ecosystem that's building around their AI offerings, so it's not just about hardware, right, we're not considering NVIDIA just a chip company anymore. It's a systems company, a software company, it's a networking company. And so I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion, again, around this concept of an AI ecosystem that NVIDIA has been busy building.""

Investors interested in artificial intelligence stocks should thus keep their eyes on the upcoming GTC conference, which is expected to bring together tech professionals for stimulating discussions on the future of AI and its impact on the world. Additionally, keeping up with the news on which AI stocks can reasonably be considered high growth stocks is also important at this point in time. As such, we have compiled a list of the fastest-growing AI stocks today, including some of the most promising AI stocks to buy and some of the most advanced AI companies to invest in.

Rate Cuts in June

As the US economy continues to settle down, financial professionals are continuing to keep a close eye on the inflation numbers and what they may imply for the markets and investors moving forward. Many are concerned about the Federal Reserve's next steps in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate cuts. Recent sentiments from the Fed have led many to believe that rate cuts may be on the way, but the progression of this process may be slower than most expected. On March 15, Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Financial Group, joined CNBC's ""The Exchange"" to discuss recent developments in this area. Here are some of his comments:

""Based on his [Powell's] testimony, just last week, he seems to wanna cut, but he wants to do it slowly and carefully, as he said.""

According to Boockvar, June is very much a possibility for a rate cut this year, particularly because it seems as though the Fed's Jerome Powell will want to position his rate cuts as far away as possible from the US Presidential election. The impact of this drawn-out strategy on the market may well be something to keep an eye on.

The NVIDIA GTC Conference

Apart from inflation news, investors should look at the position and performance of stocks in the market that have been performing well enough to keep rising. A good place to start on this front is to consider the performance of the most owned stocks by hedge funds in 2023 and beyond, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). However, perhaps one of the most exciting stocks to look at right now is the semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In the third week of March, the company is organizing its GTC Conference, bringing together tech professionals, developers, researchers, and engineers. The main topic at the 2024 GTC is going to be artificial intelligence, an area that is ripe for investment at present. On March 15, CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos joined the ""Halftime Report"" to highlight the main things to expect from the Conference. Here's what she said:

""The first thing is gonna be any update of their [NVIDIA's] architecture for a new AI chip, the Blackwell B100. We'll wanna know specs, you know, how is the memory content, if the memory content surpasses AMD's latest chip, then that's gonna be a negative for AMD. Then we'll also wanna know, maybe, some details on the average selling price, because that'll affect margins... The second major point is this adoption across enterprise... And last, not least, inferencing. Inferencing is the second part of a Large Language Model, you shoot the training in and use the training data to answer queries. On the earnings call, Jensen Huang, the CEO, said that 40% of data center revenue actually came from inferencing.""

These comments highlight the fact that the remainder of March is going to be exciting for the tech sector, particularly the AI space, so investors should keep a sharp eye on how the GTC Conference develops. Tech is an area that makes up a large part of the list of most owned stocks by hedge funds today.

Quarterly results were roughly in line with Street expectations, with strength in profitability. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud development in China.

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

AAPL,2024-03-16,"In this article, we will take a look at the 30 most expensive cities to live in the US in 2024. If you would like to skip our discussion on the US economy, you can go to the 5 Most Expensive Cities to Live in the US in 2024.

In June 2022, inflation in the US reached its highest point in four decades but subsequently decreased by December 2023. This decline can be attributed to actions such as the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates, improvements in supply chain efficiency, and a reduction in gasoline prices. However, despite the drop in inflation, it remains significantly high compared to pre-pandemic levels. The overall inflation rate in the US as of February 2024 stood at 3.2%, up from 3.1% in January. While inflation has decreased from its peak of 9.1% in 2022, it remains significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. This situation has led to financial difficulties for many Americans.

Comparing prices in December 2023 to those in January 2020 reveals a significant increase, with overall prices rising by 19%, food prices by 25%, energy prices by 26%, and shelter service prices by 21%. Meanwhile, wages for workers in private industries saw a rise of 4.3% by December 2023, compared to 5.1% in December 2022. Furthermore, US employers are planning to increase salaries by an average of 4.0% in 2024. This is slightly lower than the 4.4% increase in 2023 but still higher than the 3.1% increase seen in previous years. In 2023, pay raises outpaced inflation for the first time since 2020, highlighting a more stable job market compared to the period from 2008 to 2020.

In January 2024, the unemployment rate remained stable at 3.7% for the past three months, marking a decrease from January 2021, when it stood at 6.4%. However, despite these positive signs in the job market, the high inflation rate has continued to impact major companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). In October 2023, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), voiced concerns about the effects of increased interest rates, stating that they offset the benefits of Tesla's price reductions and lower people's ability to purchase cars. Additionally, the higher interest rates and global economic uncertainties have impacted Tesla's plans to expand its factory in Mexico.

Here's what Fred Alger Management said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:

“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla’s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company’s full self-driving capabilities.”",0.0842056846662109,0.4271992481203007,Neutral,0.7693501114845276,0.4782798091027579

AAPL,2024-03-12,"Apple Inc. is the second most valuable company in the world, approaching a $3 trillion market capitalization. Roughly 64% of Americans own an Apple product, meaning the company has massive amounts of data, and control, over the lives of hundreds of millions of people. But, the company also acts as a gatekeeper to the millions of businesses that use the Apple platform, giving it considerable control over businesses around the world.

For example, Apple charges a 30% fee on nearly every transaction for digital goods on the Apple app store. If you buy digital currency, game skins, movies or any other digital product on the Apple App Store, you are subject to this 30% fee. This has caused many of the largest names in the world to cut or amend their pricing to all because of this massive fee.

In 2018, Netflix Inc. halted all new subscriptions using Apple's App Store billing as the giant wanted a 30% cut and wouldn't let new users transact outside of Apple. After regulatory pressures and lawsuits, Apple eventually allowed Netflix users to circumvent the 30% fee by directing them to the Netflix website. Netflix subscribers haven't been able to subscribe to Netflix using the App Store billing since 2018, but many remained on their pre-2018 plans, meaning Apple took their fees. Last month, Netflix announced it would be forcing some users to change their billing method away from the App Store or risk their accounts being closed.

Amazon.com Inc. went through a similar issue with its Prime Video services, before cutting a deal to integrate with AppleTV to avoid the hefty fee.

One of the most outspoken critics of this policy is Fortnite creator and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Sweeney, an outspoken Apple critic for years, recently sued the tech giant. The company sells billions of dollars in digital goods per year on Fortnite, meaning the company pays millions in fees for those who play the game on mobile devices. Despite attempts to circumvent the issue, Apple has maintained a strong grip on Epic and others.

The equity strategy team at UBS has recently shared a forward-looking forecast for potential surprises that might unfold throughout the course of 2024. In a note written by analyst Andrew Garthwaite and his team, they clarified that the predictions outlined carry long odds and are not reflective of the bank's base-case scenario or market consensus. One of the noteworthy surprises highlighted by UBS involves the possibility of China's nominal GDP experiencing a slowdown to 3%, contrary to expectations of acceleration. Additionally, the forecast includes a potential steepening of the yield curve to 2%, challenging current market expectations. Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape.

Among the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year.

The United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a ""Goldilocks"" moment. Economists from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) anticipate faster growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in 2024. This outlook stands in stark contrast to the recession fears that prevailed in 2023. The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year. NABE forecasts a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, compared to 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Another important indicator for the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures gauge, is also predicted to ease further. The NABE anticipates the Federal Reserve initiating a reduction in its benchmark interest rate between April and June, aiming to lower borrowing costs for individuals and businesses. The record-high performance of the stock market, with both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching new highs, contributes to the positive sentiment in the American stock market.

Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Yardeni Research, told CBS News on February 26:

""As occurred during the second half of the 1990s, the stock market is having a significantly positive wealth effect on the economy now that the major stock market indexes are at record highs.”

To benefit from the growth potential in the stock markets, some of the best stocks to buy include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Wendy’s is an asset-light franchisor that earns most of its profits from royalties, franchise fees and rent. The business is insulated from food and labor inflation since 95% of the restaurant base is owned and operated by franchisees. Wendy’s topline has proven remarkably resilient through diverse economic climates, producing 12 straight years of positive same-restaurant sales. The company is well-positioned for accelerating topline growth due to its recent launch of a breakfast menu, steady market share gains, international expansion and new restaurant openings.

“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.”

Consumer electronics are widely used in households, with televisions featuring larger screens gaining popularity, while electrical components are becoming more compact. Companies are focusing on creating high-performance, user-friendly devices to meet the growing demand. This trend, along with technological advancements and digitalization, is expected to drive the demand for electronic items and household appliances. The global consumer electronics market was valued at $738.75 billion in 2022, $773.40 billion in 2023, and is projected to grow to $1,239.40 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 6.97% during the forecast period from 2024-2030, as per Fortune Business Insights. The increasing popularity of smart homes is driving the adoption of smart appliances worldwide. These appliances come with features like voice assistance, bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, offering greater convenience. As people's income levels rise, they are investing more in housing and equipping their homes with advanced technological products. The introduction of innovative household products is expected to further boost consumption. Governments worldwide are also supporting the growth of the electronics industry. For example, India aims to reach a $300 billion electronics manufacturing and export market by 2025-26, encouraging the development of technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and machine learning.

Analysts expect the US consumer electronics industry to rebound in 2024 after two years of decline, as reported by Investor’s Business Daily. The Consumer Technology Association forecasts a 2.8% increase in retail sales, reaching $512 billion this year, compared to a 3.1% decrease to $498 billion in 2023. This turnaround is attributed to a refresh cycle for personal computers, smartphones, and other devices purchased during the COVID crisis. The surge in remote work, distance learning, and stay-at-home orders during the pandemic led to increased purchases of consumer electronics and digital services. Moreover, the introduction of artificial intelligence features is expected to drive upgrades of PCs, smartphones, and other devices in 2024, according to Richard Kowalski, senior director of business intelligence for the CTA. He commented:

“AI is already incorporated in many devices and services. Think about the natural language processing in our digital assistants, computer vision in our vehicle safety systems and health tracking algorithms in our smartwatches.”

The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 contributed to consumer awareness and interest in generative AI, as per Brian Comiskey, CTA's director of thematic programs. Comiskey anticipates augmented reality and virtual reality headsets to be growth drivers in consumer electronics this year. The Consumer Technology Association predicts that consumer software and services revenue will outpace hardware sales, growing by 3.8% to $163 billion. This segment is led by entertainment software and services, including audio, video, and gaming. On the other hand, consumer electronics hardware sales are expected to increase by 2.3% to $349 billion, reversing a 5.4% decline in 2023.

The Consumer Electronics Show 2024 was a showcase of cutting-edge technology and a glimpse into the future of tech. According to Forbes, Artificial intelligence and machine learning took the spotlight, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) introducing new GenAI-powered Alexa experiences. Intuition Robotics unveiled a more advanced version of its eldercare robot, ElliQ, using AI to engage elderly users in activities that promote cognitive and social wellness. LG Display Co., Ltd. (NYSE:LPL) showcased a smart home robot with two-legged mobility and user recognition, integrating seamlessly with smart appliances. Healthcare technology featured the Motion Pillow by Motionsleep, which uses AI to detect snoring and adjust head position, improving sleep quality. In entertainment, ultra-high-definition displays and immersive audio systems offered cinematic experiences at home. LG Display Co., Ltd. (NYSE:LPL) launched the Signature OLED T 4K transparent wireless TV, along with innovative kitchen appliances, pet tech, and laptops, highlighting the diverse applications of technology. CES 2024 showcased the rapid evolution of consumer electronics and technology.

“Reviewing Vizio (NYSE:VZIO), we purchased it quite recently and it has declined precipitously in our brief period of ownership. They have an explicit strategy to sacrifice gross margins from their TVs to further develop the audience for their smart TV offering, a competitor to Roku. I purchased the shares expecting the thesis to play out over a number of years, so I intend to monitor the company and its results as we move forward. Their first quarter results reflected strength in their Platform (Smart TV) segment, which will be their primary source of profit going forward. Further, the news that Netflix and other streaming companies are considering subscriptions that include advertising is positive news. In some ways, what is old is new again, as this development is somewhat of a return to the dual-revenue-stream model cable TV channels use. The shift towards more streaming programming including advertisements is a positive for Vizio, since they may be able to monetize the ads directly or indirectly. I’ll keep you posted on their progress.”

Here is what Roubaix Capital has to say about GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) in their Q4 2020 investor letter:

“Companies like GoPro (GPRO) should benefit from the consumer rebound, but also have their own unique drivers of value over the next 2+ years. In the case of GPRO, the company launched its newest action camera, the GoPro9, under the umbrella of a new business model. The company offers a discount on the camera when customers purchase a subscription agreement that comes with additional services and benefits. The uptake of the subscription has been strong to date and offers the company a line of sight to a higher margin and more predictable revenue stream. The stock’s low double digit earnings multiple remains undemanding. We have seen this type of transformation play out in numerous situations in software, hardware and even retail companies such as RH. We see GPRO following suit and expect a return to travel later this year to be another reason for consumers to buy a new camera as they head back out on vacation.”

AAPL,2024-03-04,"In this article, we discuss 12 stocks most bought by hedge funds. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape and the performance of popular hedge funds, head over to 5 Stocks Most Bought By Hedge Funds.

In 2023, the world's top 20 hedge funds delivered significant returns of $67 billion, tripling the previous year's performance, as reported by LCH Investments in January 2024. TCI Fund Management, headed by billionaire Christopher Hohn, led the group with $12.9 billion in returns after fees. On average, the top 20 managers achieved a 10.5% gain in 2023, surpassing the industry's overall return of 6.4%. Multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, Millennium Management, and D. E. Shaw, known for using leverage, were the top three funds by lifetime gains. Despite representing only 4.6% of the industry's assets, these three firms generated 38.3% of the industry's returns over the past three years. Citadel, with $74 billion in gains since 1990, maintained its leading position in 2023, returning 15.3%, while also deciding to return approximately $7 billion to investors. Pershing Square, led by William Ackman, re-entered the rankings for the first time since 2015, securing the 20th position with $18.8 billion in returns since 2004, and achieving a return of 26.7% in 2023, outperforming the broader stock market. On the other hand, Bridgewater Associates and Caxton Associates were the only firms among the top 20 that posted losses. The strong performance in 2023 followed a challenging 2022 marked by market turbulence due to the war in Ukraine and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The top 20 hedge funds have collectively generated substantial profits, totaling $755.4 billion since their inception, surpassing their total managed assets of $655.5 billion, according to the research findings.

Brad Amiee, Director and Head of Research at LCH Investments, attributes the success of leading hedge funds in 2023 to the impressive performance of the stock market during the year. He noted that in addition to benefiting from the overall positive market conditions, many of these funds demonstrated particularly astute stock selection strategies. In a statement to Financial Times, Amiee said:

“You could argue that, since shorting is such a challenging sub-strategy, keeping things long-biased and having a concentrated portfolio of high quality positions has been the way to go.”

The robust performance of top financiers correlates with the overall stock market rally in 2023, particularly benefiting hedge funds that focus on specific stock picks. Many in the industry have heavily invested in the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. However, concerns are rising on Wall Street about the concentration of investments in these same companies. The data highlights a growing disparity in the hedge fund industry, with the top 20 firms managing just under 19% of the total $3.5 trillion assets but representing 46% of the sector's cumulative gains.

In 2024, global hedge funds are facing pressure to enhance returns due to a robust stock rally and increased bond yields, aiming to counteract investor outflows. Last year, investors withdrew a net $75 billion from hedge funds, following a significant outflow of $112 billion in 2022. Investors, seeking double-digit returns in 2024, are interested in credit, global macro, commodity, and equity long/short strategies. Some potential approaches include adopting ""barbell"" portfolios and exploring bond-trading strategies, given the potential impact of rising rates on refinancing costs for companies. Hedge funds focusing on diverse macroeconomic signals are also gaining attention, particularly as central banks are expected to adjust monetary policies.

Some of the most owned stocks by hedge funds include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Our Methodology

We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and picked the top 12 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120

Jackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

AAPL,2024-03-01,"Apple Inc. is constantly looking for new and innovative ways to spend its $73 billion war chest. From the Vision Pro to the Apple Car, it's rolling out new products and producing the next generation of consumer technology. Last week, it was reported that its decade-long Apple Car project is coming to an end. But it looks like the trillion-dollar titan has a new focus: artificial intelligence.

In a bold move toward integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its ecosystem, Apple is setting the stage to unveil a series of generative AI-based tools at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. This initiative, part of iOS 18, signifies a significant leap in Apple’s AI strategy, showcasing a new version of Siri enhanced with generative AI capabilities. The upgrade promises a range of new functionalities, aiming to revolutionize user interactions with Apple devices​​.

Don't Miss:

This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

This $0.25 per share Boston startup is fixing a glaring problem with today's online advertising and is currently crowdfunding.

Apple’s AI ambitions extend beyond Siri. The company is reportedly planning to introduce an AI-based tool for completing lines of software code, akin to Microsoft Corp.‘s Copilot. Microsoft continues to be a magnate in the AI space. It has invested billions in OpenAI in a profit-sharing agreement that has also helped power the company's suite of AI-based tools.

This tool, expected to be integrated into Apple’s Xcode software, could simplify the development process by automatically completing code blocks, potentially transforming how developers work on the Apple platform. In addition to code completion, Apple is exploring AI features for automating Apple Music playlists and enhancing its business presentation software. These advancements indicate Apple’s broader goal to infuse AI across its product range, enhancing user experience and productivity​​.

Trending: Peter Thiel, Mark Cuban and Warren Buffett funded early-stage startups and made millions. You don't need to be a well-connected billionaire to do the same.

Apple’s approach to AI development is characterized by strategic partnerships and technological innovation. The company has been in talks with major publishers for rights to train its generative AI systems using their content, aiming for multiyear agreements. This step underscores Apple’s commitment to refining its AI capabilities through access to vast data sets, ensuring that its AI tools are both powerful and informed by a wide range of information sources​​.",0.0805500658761528,0.5723649538866931,Positive,0.9409745931625366,0.5131662181308416
AAPL,2024-03-01,"Roundhill Investments, the thematic ETF issuer with $870.7 million in assets, is doubling down on the Magnificent Seven with a pair of funds, including one for bets the stocks will rise and the other for investors who want to profit on their decline.

The asset manager known for its metaverse and gaming exchange-traded funds launched the Roundhill Daily 2X Long Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGX), which offers twice the daily performance of the famed seven tech equities, by investing at least 80% of its portfolio in equal weight exposure to Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Tesla Inc. The Roundhill Daily Inverse Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGQ) give inverse exposure to the same basket of stocks.

The funds, which began trading today, are designed for ""sophisticated traders,"" the company said in a statement. MAGX dropped 1.6% to $25.15 in afternoon trading while MAGQ rose 0.1% to $24.86.

The seven stocks were coined the “Magnificent Seven” as they largely drove the bull market that started last year. The group makes up about a quarter of the value of the 3,700 or so publicly traded U.S. companies. Fueled by artificial intelligence excitement and the launch of AI products such as Chat GPT, investors bet big on chipmakers like Nvidia and chatbot creators such as Microsoft.

“We saw an opportunity to provide both investors and traders with the full toolkit to express their opinion on the Magnificent Seven,” explained Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer of Roundhill in an interview with etf.com about the new launches.

The launch follows the November conversion of Roundhill's BIGT fund into the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which has not had a day of outflows so far this year, pulling in $106.2 million while gaining 13%, according to etf.com data.

While MAGS is for investors, MAGX and MAGQ is for traders, Mazza said.

“Particularly the 2x version is only appropriate for traders who have the ability to monitor their positions on a daily basis,” explained Mazza.

While the Magnificent Seven drove the S&P 500 to record highs and pushed the Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ) to gain over 50% last year, in 2024 only four of the seven stocks have really pulled their weights.

Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have been responsible for 75% of the S&P 500’s gain in 2024, according to a research note from LPL Financial.",0.2334190115440115,0.4901334776334776,Neutral,0.9999790191650392,0.4911589338309232
AAPL,2024-02-29,"""So with that as a backdrop, I’d like to highlight some of the progress we’ve made within the quarter. In partnership with NVIDIA, we launched our generative AI service at the end of the quarter. The service is truly unique and addresses fundamental customer needs. Our model is trained solely with Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) best-in-class content, addressing the legal risk that is pervasive in many other models that are trained with third-party intellectual property scraped from the web. We also believe this equates to higher quality outputs as a cake is only as good as its ingredients. With generative AI by Getty Images, users can be confident that the content they generate is safe to use in commercial settings and will not include any trademark brands, products, characters, or identifiable people. It also does not produce deep takes or emulate the style of specific orders, which we believe is valued by our editorial and creative customers respectively. We are rewarding our contributors with an ongoing share of each and every dollar we earn from the service. Last but certainly not least, the service and all of its outputs come with Getty Images uncapped indemnification. In terms of the economics, customers pay to generate versus download, which better aligns to our costs and recognize the value of ideation. Initial customer feedback and engagement with the service has been really positive and we have already introduced new features to the service such as being able to prompt in over 70 languages. And we’re engaged with a limited set of customers to custom-train models to their IP and brand needs.""

8. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 28

Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) ranks eighth in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recommended in his Lightning Round program on CNBC this week. Cramer said Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) stock is down ""on an opportunity."" Cramer quoted Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) skeptics who say there is a lot of oversaturation in the market for self-storage companies. Cramer said in response to these naysayers:

""Give me a break. These guys are very smart operators. I want to buy the stock.""

In addition to PSA, Cramer is also recommending Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Baron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“In the most recently reported quarter, business results for Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), a REIT that is the world’s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, were mildly disappointing as occupancy trends and rents moderated as a result of less housing-related movement and a more price-sensitive consumer. We decided to sell our position because we believe near-term rent and overall cash-flow growth may remain subdued. We are likely to revisit Public Storage in the future.”

7. DigitalBridge Group Inc (NYSE:DBRG)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 31

A caller recently asked Jim Cramer about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG), which he said was once a REIT but later transformed into a ""profitable global alternative asset manager."" Jim Cramer said he remembers DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) from its REIT days and wanted the company to do exactly what it's doing today. Jim Cramer said DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) is a ""good stock"" and praised the caller for making the right call on the stock.

Ave Maria Focused Fund made the following comment about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) started its life with particularly complicated financials as the two data center businesses it owned directly obfuscated the economics of its asset management business. However, DigitalBridge plans to divest enough of their ownership in these two businesses that they will no longer be required to consolidate them in their reported financials. Consequently, its reported financials will be much simpler to analyze and reflect the profile of a pure-play alternative asset manager. DigitalBridge differentiates itself by focusing exclusively on digital infrastructure, an asset class that institutional allocators are severely under allocated to. DigitalBridge is actively fundraising for its third flagship investment fund. With an expected 11-year fund life, this fund could generate fees for the company and its investors for a long time.

6. Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 44

Jim Cramer was recently asked about Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during his ""Lightning Round"" program on CNBC. Cramer said Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is one of his ""absolute favorite stocks."" Jim Cramer said that there's ""such a fantastic narrative there.""

In addition to Cloudflare, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Most of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: • Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare’s platform: “And so we’re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass… that comes through in a lot of customer examples…. people want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that’s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.”

9. Bigcommerce Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BIGC)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 10

Jim Cramer was recently asked whether ecommerce SaaS platform company Bigcommerce Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BIGC) shares should be bought. Cramer's reply was ""no"" because he thinks ""we got Amazon.""

Cramer has long been a believer of best of breed stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and he believes when there's a first-grade, top quality player available in any industry it should be given preference instead of buying other smaller players.

8. C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15

Jim Cramer has said in the past that there's too much hype around the shares of C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI). Earlier this month he was yet again asked about the stock. Cramer said he does not see ""any earnings"" there and he cannot recommend a stock ""that has no earnings.""

However, Cramer praised C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI) CEO Thomas Siebel and said he's a ""bankable guy"" and he's known Siebel for 30 years.

To ride the AI wave Cramer recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Bireme Capital stated the following regarding C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Our final new short position is in a company called C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). Originally named “C3 Energy,” C3.ai has changed its name multiple times based on whatever hot new trend they were supposedly capitalizing on. The “energy” theme was about smart grid and cap-and-trade. Then the firm changed its name to “C3 IoT” to attempt to capitalize on the Internet of Things buzz. After that trend fizzled out, the moniker was altered once more, with the company capturing the “AI” ticker in December 2020 – a savvy move if it wants to sell stock to credulous investors, but irrelevant to its business prospects. As Kerrisdale put it, the company is a “minor, cash burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company.”

7. Cal-Maine Foods Inc (NASDAQ:CALM)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 19

Jim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Mississippi-based fresh eggs producer Cal-Maine Foods Inc (NASDAQ:CALM). Cramer said it's an ""unnecessary stock to own."" Cramer however said he does like Tyson Foods from a valuation perspective.

The dividend-paying company missed fiscal Q2 estimates when it posted earnings in January. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $0.35, missing estimates by $0.48. Revenue in the quarter fell 34.7% year over year to $523.23 million, missing estimates by $2.16 million

Diamond Hill Small Cap Fund made the following comment about Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“On an individual holdings’ basis, top contributors to return in Q3 included Civitas Resources and Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM). Fresh egg producer Cal-Maine Foods has positioned itself well to capitalize on the growing trend toward cage-free and specialty eggs. In May, the US Supreme Court upheld Proposition 12, whereby California can dictate only cage-free eggs be sold in the state — an outcome which will likely open the door for other states to either institute or maintain similar mandates, and which should drive increased long-term demand for Cal-Maine Foods’ eggs.”

6. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22

Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from. Last month Cramer said he was taking a ""hard pass"" on the stock. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) shares are however up about 4.4% year to date through February 25.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds out of the 933 funds had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The most notable stakeholder of Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) was Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $175 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).

Instead of SGRY, Cramer is recommending big stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”

Jim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks

Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks

Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks",0.0769910454841961,0.4080175532230327,Neutral,0.99383544921875,0.5340788097749906
AAPL,2024-02-25,"And as we've seen through major stock performance in 2024, seems like investors are impressed. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's shares are up by 7.64%, 35%, 13%, and 49.7%, year to date, respectively. This shows that even though small cap stocks that are often touted for their ability to deliver double digit and higher percentage returns, major stocks the likes of some of the magnificent seven that we've talked about above can also stun everyone given the market and economic contexts align in their favor.

Before we head on to the best major stocks to buy, another big news for these stocks this year has come from Meta. Meta has traditionally been a high growth technology company whose income statement for years was a classic example of a venture capital model that saw negative profits but revenue growth. Yet in 2024 Meta declared a 50 cent dividend for the first time in its history to mark its entry into the list of stable big guns that can regularly pay out their profits to investors as a reward for patience and belief.

So, as major stocks continue to shine, which ones are hedge funds interested in? We took a look and some notable picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Our Methodology

To make our list of the best major stocks to buy, we made a list of the common top constituents of the S&P 500 index and the NASDAQ 100 index and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of Q4 2023 end. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen as the best major stocks to buy.

For these best major stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

AAPL,2024-02-25,"In this piece, we will take a look at Ken Fisher's latest investment portfolio and the 12 biggest positions. If you want to skip our overview of Fisher, his investment firm, and the broader U.S. stock market and macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at Ken Fisher Portfolio: 5 Biggest Positions.

Ken Fisher is one of the richest people in the world courtesy of his hedge fund Fisher Asset Management. The fund had $203 billion in investments spread across its portfolio according to filings with the SEC. Fisher set up his hedge fund nearly five decades ago in 1979 and served as its CEO until 2016 before relinquishing the role. Right now, he's the Executive Chairman of Fisher Investments and holds the title of co-chief investment officer along with Jeff Silk.

A $203 billion investment portfolio is no small achievement, even if the highly risky nature of the hedge fund industry sees the biggest players such as Ken Griffin's Citadel and Seth Klarman's Baupost often take leverage to fund their bets and double their returns. Investment portfolios of this size mean that not only do Fisher Investment's clients have to trust the firm, but also that the hedge fund has to demonstrate that it is able to outperform either the market or the economy or at least serve as a buffer against sharp capital depreciation during times of economic turmoil.

The start of the year is the tone setting mood for stock markets, and for Fisher Investments, the year did not miss out on a beat after the firm had to jump in to release an unusual press release. This press release countered a report by the Wall Street Journal that had stated that Ken Fisher's firm, over which he holds 100% control through a trust that he shares with his wife, was being sold to the Boston, Massachusetts based private equity firm Advent International. The WSJ was not the only publication that cited anonymous sources for its report, as Bloomberg also published a similar piece which outlined that Advent had had talks to ""acquire billionaire Ken Fisher's eponymous Fisher Investments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter"" but also went on to quote Fisher Investment's response that bluntly denied any such speculation.

In fact Fisher's firm, which is quite widely covered in the press and is known for its founder's ability to generate buzz, was quite hard hitting its response. Its press release bluntly stated:

Fisher Investments is not being bought by Advent International, or anyone else—plain and simple.

The WSJ's coverage had speculated that not only was Advent having 'talks' to acquire Fisher Investments, but that the hedge fund might see other partners emerge for a deal. Reading Fisher's press release, while it did deny that a transaction was not officially underway, the text nevertheless missed out on sharing any details of potential 'talks' - leading to the assumption that since there were no talks for a potential sale, there was no need to deny them in the press release.

Moving forward to other news in 2024, the year has started off by providing investors with the latest data set to read the tea leaves and see where the Federal Reserve's current interest rate hiking cycle will be at the year's close. This data set is the retail sales for January which showed an 0.8% annual drop that came as part of a release that saw the Commerce Department also revise down the data for December.

On the surface, this data paints a softer picture of the economy that shows that as consumers face the pinch of high interest rates, they are starting to cut down their spending. However, economists also preached caution after the release, as they speculated that while it is possible that a spending, and by extension economic, slump had led to the sales falling, the contribution of cold temperatures across the U.S. could not be completely ignored in the aftermath of the release.

However, and as has been the case for more than a year now, the optimistic data set was followed by the exact opposite just a day later. On Friday, data from the Labor Department revealed that import prices jumped by 0.8% in January, which was the high reading since the first quarter of 2022. In short, nearly a two year old record of an inflationary indicator was broken, and perhaps unsurprisingly, when paired by the producer price index (PPI)'s 0.3% jump in January, futures linked to the S&P 500 and other indexes dropped.

With the fourth quarter hedge fund filing season well on its way, we decided to see which stocks Fisher Investments is piling into as the year gets off to a roaring start. Some notable names are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

AAPL,2024-02-25,"In this article, we discuss the 11 cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence industry, go directly to the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit the ground running since last year, and there seems to be no end in sight to it in the near future. The PwC Emerging Technology Survey suggests that after the launch of ChatGPT, more than half of the surveyed companies have introduced generative AI in some form to their business. The AI stocks also performed quite well in 2023 and are still trending in 2024. The Magnificent 7 stocks outperformed the rest of the S&P 493 heavily in the year, and analysts like Goldman Sachs' David Kostin are positive that the gains will continue in 2024. The seven big tech stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which were the top performers of the group, collectively gained around 75% during the previous year compared to 12% gains for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index.

Other than the big tech, AI technology gave a boost to a range of AI companies. The Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (IGPT) gained over 30% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 25% growth. Moreover, the ETF is also 15.80% higher year-to-date (YTD) at the time of the February 23 market close, compared to the S&P 500’s 7.3% gains.

AI is changing the face of every sector in the market. For example, the mortgage finance company Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE:RKT) uses AI for mortgage banking, underwriting, and servicing. In 2023, The company piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers and outbound client calls.

In addition, the real estate company Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) sets up networks and data centers, making it quite exposed to potential growth in AI computer facilities. At the company’s Q4 2023 earnings call CEO Charles Meyers said:

“We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.

Effects of AI on Labor

An International Monetary Fund (IMF) report defines AI as a double-edged sword. While AI can potentially create many jobs, it can also replace human labor in several other areas. The IMF believes that nearly 40% of the jobs around the world are exposed to AI. In the developed countries, 60% of the jobs will be affected by the new technology creating a higher risk/reward situation for their labor markets. However, the report mentions that wealthier countries are also better equipped to adopt AI.

For emerging economies and under-developed nations, the IMF suggests laying concrete groundwork and infrastructure to be better prepared for the AI revolution in the job market.

The artificial intelligence industry is on the rise, and it’s significantly far away from its peak. This creates some entry points for investors in cheap AI companies. Keeping that in mind, some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024 include Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).

Our Methodology

For this article, we identified 30 stocks trading on NYSE and NASDAQ that directly benefit from the rise of AI or are actively working for the growth of the artificial intelligence space. Next, we chose the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside as of February 23. The analyst price targets were taken from TipRanks. We only chose the companies that were covered by at least two analysts and didn’t have many Hold or Sell ratings, as compared to Buy-equivalent ratings. The 11 best cheap AI stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside.

We also added the number of hedge fund investors for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Analysts

11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 11.40%

Average Analyst Price Target: $196.65

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) takes the 11th spot on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy. It produces semiconductor devices and its products, including AMD Vitis AI platform, MI300, and Ryzen 8040 laptop processors are driven by and designed for AI applications.

34 Wall Street analysts covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) over the last three months, and 29 maintained a Buy rating on the stock. As of the February 23 market close, the average price target of $196.65 represented an upside of 11.40%.

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.95%

Average Analyst Price Target: $206.15

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is famously known for its signature consumer electronics and more, but it has been working tirelessly to integrate AI and machine learning into its products.

On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable by February 15 to the shareholders of record on February 12. The stock’s dividend yield was 0.53% as of the February 23 market close.

Mairs & Power mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“The Fund’s relative performance was negatively impacted by what we didn’t own as well. In particular, not holding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for most of the year cost the Fund more than 300bps (basis points) of performance. Apple may be the best-known company in the world and its seemingly ubiquitous iPhone holds a dominant share of the global cell phone market. Apple is even more dominant among Millennials and Gen Zers, which should lead to even greater market share as these cohorts age. This loyal user base should pay huge dividends for shareholders as Apple continues to monetize this ecosystem, especially as the company delves deeper into services, payments, and AI. We initiated a position in Apple during the fourth quarter and await a more attractive entry point to add to our position.”

9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.33%

Average Analyst Price Target: $164.59

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 214

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest tech holding companies and has many AI-driven products under its belt, including Bard, Gemini 1.5, and more.

On February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) introduced its new next-generation AI model, named Gemini 1.5. The mid-size multimodal model is set to be released for testing soon and will be called the Gemini 1.5 Pro version.

According to Insider Monkey’s database which tracks 933 elite hedge funds, 214 funds had investments in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock in the fourth quarter. With 45.22 million shares worth $6.3 billion, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management was the top investor in the company.

First Pacific Advisors stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”

8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.44%

Average Analyst Price Target: $469.58

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 302

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been long making headlines in the AI industry with its investments in AI companies and AI products like Azure AI.

On February 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith took to Twitter and announced that the company would be investing $2.1 billion over the next two years to develop the AI infrastructure in Spain.

On February 15, it was reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning on furthering the AI infrastructure in Germany through an investment of 3.2 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in the next two years.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was mentioned in Baron Funds’ fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Our biggest purchase in the fourth quarter was a new position we initiated in the software platform Microsoft Corporation. While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund, we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy. However, Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric, on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers. Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly. Over time, Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share, while becoming a more important driver for the company. For example, in the last quarterly earnings release, Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors. A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year. Just to put this in perspective, $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business, it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue. We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner, global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $4.7 trillion worldwide IT spending.

7. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 17.66%

Average Analyst Price Target: $122.30

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20

Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a California-based company that designs and sells user interface solutions, and many of them are integrated with AI, like its Smart Home SoC solution. It ranks seventh on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.

On February 9, Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy raised the price target on Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)’s stock to $130 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.

On February 8, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) released its Q2 earnings result with a non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, which beat the estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $237 million topped the estimates by $1.33 million.

TimesSquare Capital Management made the following comment about Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:

“In the Information Technology sector, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) develops and markets semiconductor product solutions. Their products enable users to interact more easily with smartphones, notebooks, tablets, and other portable multi-media devices. While the fiscal third quarter results were in line with sell-side projections, forward guidance was worse than expected. Management sees growing macroeconomic headwinds further impacting IT budgets, and the inventory draw-down has been slower than they had anticipated on weaker sell-through trends. Synaptics lost -23% and we added to the position.”

6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 18.07%

Average Analyst Price Target: $653.43

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a California-based company that manufactures and sells computer software and its Adobe Sensei is just one feather among many in its hat when it comes to AI technology.

Out of 30 Wall Street analysts that covered Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the last three months, 24 kept a Buy rating on the stock. The average price target of $653.43 had an upside of 18.07% as of the February 23 market close.

Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) are some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, besides Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).

Polen Capital commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

Considering the thousands of companies that trade on stock markets such as the NASDAQ and the NYSE as well as the plethora of information that investors are bombarded with every day, investing sometimes appears as nothing short of wizardry. For novices, terms such as relative strength indexes (RSIs), standard deviations of returns, beta, earnings per share, yields, and other metrics appear to be a new language that requires a detailed study before one can become comfortable with it.

One investor who literally describes his investment strategy as 'magic' is Joel Greenblatt. Mr. Greenblatt is the chief investment officer of the ominously named Gotham Asset Management. While his investment decisions focus mostly on making returns for investors rather than fighting crime, Mr. Greenblatt's approach has nevertheless won him more fame in financial markets than Bruce Wayne. He set up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, which makes the fund relatively younger when compared to some other funds that have been around for decades.

However, before Gotham Asset Management, the Magic Formula investor was at the helm of the fund Gotham Capital. He set up Gotham Capital in 1985, and the fund successfully focused on investing in distressed or 'special situation' companies and stocks. These stocks are of firms that might be facing troubles in managing their debt, or they might be struggling in their markets due to choices made of their own accord or broader macroeconomic factors. Mr. Greenblatt's Gotham Capital was one of the top performing funds in its league back in the mid 80s and 90s as it delivered net 30% returns during the time periods.

Like some other hedge fund and investing heavyweights like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, Mr. Greenblatt is also an adherent of one of Wall Street's best known investment approaches. If you haven't guessed it already, this approach is called Value Investing. Value investing simply analyzes a stock to compute what the investor believes is a fair value of the shares. This value is then compared to the market price of the stock, and if it's higher than the market price, then a potential investment decision is made. This investment decision is also influenced by the difference between fair and market values. The higher this difference is, the more comfortable an investor is buying the shares as it leaves a greater 'margin of safety' for non fundamental downward share price movements.

So where's the magic? Well, Mr. Greenblatt's flavor of value investing is called Magic Formula investing. This strategy is based on the two fundamental metrics of share price and stock valuation. These are the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. For the uninitiated, the ROCE divides a firm's operating income by the sum of its working capital and net fixed assets. The logic behind this computation is that the ROCE measures the return to investors over the costs of doing business as measured by buying and selling inventory and spending on assets. The earnings yield of a stock is its earnings per share divided by the share price, and it enables investors to understand the true post expenses, tax, and interest ability of their investment to make money.

In Magic Formula investing, the ROCE and earnings yield of stocks are calculated first. They are then ranked according to these metrics, and the top shares are bought and held for the long term to benefit from a firm's ability to capitalize on its assets and cash to turn a profit and return for investors.

So what are some magic formula stocks that can deliver magical returns? We took a look today, and some top stock picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW).

Markets wavered as latest data showed inflation in January 2024 was hotter-than-expected. But many analysts believe the markets overreacted as a single month's data can only delay the Fed's planned rate cuts for 2024. UBS Global Wealth Management on February 20 said it expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in June instead of May. UBS expects the first rate cut to be of 25 basis points.

""Given the upside surprises to both payrolls and inflation, we now expect the Fed to wait a bit longer before cutting rates,"" UBS economists said in a note.

UBS is expecting 75 bps of cuts in 2024, lower than its previous estimate of 100 bps cuts.

The era of elevated interest rates might be prolonged amid a resilient labor market and stubborn inflation but sooner or later the Fed will begin to cut rates. That means good times might be coming for small-cap stocks or risky equities, including penny stocks, which have hitherto suffered as investors' shunned smaller companies to find refuge in high quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Historical data showed small-cap stocks perform exceptionally well in the first 12 months of the Fed's first rate cut.

Lord Abbett in its December 2023 report took a detailed look at what the private investment management company called a dovish ""pivot"" of the Federal Reserve where it hinted that its interest rate cycle might have peaked. The Lord Abbett report also said small-cap companies perform well during rate cuts.

""Currently, in fixed income, we find the short duration space to be attractive and underallocated. A “bull-steepening” environment, like what we’ve seen when the Fed turns dovish on policy, favors short duration. At the same time, the normalized rate environment can make active, opportunistic credit an attractive diversifier with expected returns at current yields rivaling equities. Equities, particularly small caps, historically have done very well when inflation falls and in Fed rate-cut cycles while growth equities have done well when growth slows. Finally, a more normalized rate environment means less of the “financing for everyone” that was prevalent in the zero-interest-rate era. Going forward, quality companies with greater financial strength should be able to differentiate in terms of financial performance and demand a premium. All in all, the Fed’s dovish December pivot shocked the markets and set the table for better performance by risk assets in 2024. What a difference a week can make,"" the report added.

If you want to skip our overview of the latest trends in the world of gold and minerals, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Gold Mining Companies to Invest In According to Analysts.

Gold serves as a safe-haven investment, sought by investors to mitigate risks associated with factors like inflation, geopolitical tensions, and financial instability. These variables often contribute to gold price volatility, as witnessed in 2022 and early 2023. Gold surged to over $2,000 per ounce during this period due to concerns regarding inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. However, the market experienced significant price fluctuations as investors evaluated the possibility of a recession against the backdrop of increasing interest rates, inflation, and other dynamics.

A Bloomberg report released earlier in 2023 unveiled a notable trend among global sovereign wealth funds and investors toward accumulating gold. Invesco's analysis was based on a survey encompassing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks, collectively managing assets totaling around $21 trillion. The report underscored the sentiment surrounding gold, noting that ""a significant portion of central banks express concerns about the precedent set by the US freezing of Russian reserves, with the majority (58%) agreeing that this event has heightened the appeal of gold."" The survey findings underscored gold's enduring role as an inflation hedge, with a considerable number of central banks indicating intentions to bolster their gold reserves over the next three years.

Amidst forecasts of persistent upward trends in gold prices fueled by geopolitical tensions and uncertainties, Netherlands-based ING Group predicts a continuation of the surge witnessed in 2023 into 2024. The initial surge in gold prices followed the outbreak of conflict in Israel earlier in the year, and despite tensions easing, prices have remained high. ING Group anticipates that the Federal Reserve will begin reducing interest rates in May 2024, with a total expected reduction of 150 basis points throughout the year, and an additional 100 basis points in early 2025. These rate cuts are forecasted to bolster gold prices in 2024.",0.1864,0.3956,Positive,0.6305067539215088,0.4458539694742251

The US stock market's euphoria came crashing down recently when latest data showed inflation remains sticky and the soft landing scenario many had started to take as a given might not be easy to achieve. Ever since the inflation storm began, wise investors had been recommending piling into recession-proof, high-quality blue chip stocks that can weather economic volatility. While a single month's bad inflation numbers do not mean doom and gloom for the stock market, many analysts believe we are in for a long period of inflation and risks where low-quality stocks should be completely avoided. Russell Investments in its 2024 outlook report said that while recession was avoided in 2023, risks in 2024 are high because the consumer savings that protected Americans from recession last year are expected to be exhausted this year.

""Corporations and households built strong defenses against Fed tightening following the pandemic, accumulating large cash reserves and locking in low interest rates on 30-year mortgages and longer-term corporate bonds. These defenses, however, are beginning to crumble. Households will soon exhaust their excess savings, while significantly higher interest rates—which have become a constraint on new borrowing—will create refinancing issues. We think this cycle may be a case of this time is longer rather than this time is different with regards to the lagged impact of aggressive Fed tightening on the U.S. economy. Recession in 2024 might be avoided, but the risks are elevated.""

In this environment it's important to see which blue chip stocks smart money investors are piling into.

While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component.

AAPL,2024-02-16,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer's Top 11Stock Picks This Week. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's Top 5Stock Picks This Week.

Jim Cramer earlier this week talked about ""froth"" in the market which he believes could be a ""bummer"" albeit ""enjoyable"" at the same time. Cramer said that while the market has been up for 14 out of the last 15 weeks, many circles believe that is not a good development since too much enthusiasm in the market could be a telltale sign of future declines. Jim Cramer gave some examples of what he calls ""exuberance"" in the market. Cramer talked about Arm Holdings' huge stock price gains posted recently. Arm Holdings stock is up about 84% over the past one month. The stock is rising mostly on the back of the AI enthusiasm as investors believe the UK-based semiconductor company could see a huge demand for its chips just like Nvidia.

Cramer Talks About Market ""Froth"" and Lack of Discipline

But these gains are just too much for Cramer, who yelled ""give me a break"" when talking about Arm Holdings. Cramer said most of the people buying ARM have no idea what they are doing and said they ""just have no discipline.""

Cramer also said that the NASDAQ is currently going through a ""parabolic rally"" and such rallies are ""never sustainable.""

In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.

The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.

The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.

Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.

To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11.

“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.

9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024.

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 134

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 7th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. On February 1, Apple Inc.

Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”

6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 163

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in. On January 30, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported its fourth quarter results.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has reintroduced its AI chatbot, now named Gemini, as a subscription service with different tiers, following a model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT.

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”

AAPL,2024-02-10,"In This Article:

The S&P 500 closed above 5,000 points for the first time, as investors continued piling into the artificial intelligence and other technology companies that have pushed the index higher, betting those stocks have fuel in the tank for future runs.

The index has gained 5.4% this year, adding to last year's 28% jump. The $486.6 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the largest exchange-traded fund, closed above $500 for the first time, finishing the day at $501.16.

The S&P 500 rose 0.6% today to close at 5026.61. It first traded above 5,000 on Thursday, Feb. 8 before backing down.

Amid a variety of potentially bad economic and global news, including interest rate cut delays, budget battles, and political uncertainty in the U.S., investors have still bet on rising technology stocks and continued consumer spending. Meanwhile, unemployment is down, price inflation has been dropping from historic highs, and wages and consumer confidence are up.

“5,000 might just be an arbitrary round number, but it's exciting for investors to see after a two-year bear market,” said etf.com analyst Sumit Roy.

Better than expected tech earnings from companies such as Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc., and Amazon.com, Inc. in recent days drove the index higher and helped turn around a beginning-of-the-year slump in stocks. The broad index, which captures exposure to many of the largest U.S.-based corporations, is up 4.8% this year so far and 11% in the past six months, largely driven by a few high-flying tech socks referred to as the Magnificent 7.

S&P 500, SPY Hit Milestones

A Feb. 2 jobs report offered more positive news for investors pushing the stock market higher. The January report showed unemployment lowering and wage increases for many workers.

The index covered the last 1,000 points in an almost three-year roller-coaster ride, having hit 4,000 in April 2021.

Top issuers have their own funds that offer exposure to the S&P 500, which is considered to be a broad barometer of the market. Other S&P 500 ETFs include the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO).

The Nasdaq 100, a tech-heavy index, is up 40% over the past year.

AAPL,2024-02-09,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best FAANG stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.

From FAANG to the Magnificent 7 and Beyond

The technology sector has been on a steady rise for quite a while now, and the most obvious answer to the industry's propulsion to greater and greater heights is the ongoing obsession with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Many within the AI space today are large tech companies, such as the FAANG names. These days, however, a new moniker has been on the rise to identify the best tech companies of the day: the Magnificent Seven.

The original cohort of tech names to keep an eye on included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), all coming together to form the FAANG group. Today, these companies are challenged by several others in the market, particularly semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA isn't alone either, and so the original list of FAANG stocks has had to accommodate the rise of new and old mega-tech companies bolstered by the emergence of AI.

Regardless of what you call these companies or who joins these new exciting groups, the fact remains that the tech sector has been abuzz with news of innovations, rising investments, and higher profitability. At the end of the day, it's starting to look like tech companies really are starting to rule the world.

The Three AI Amigos

On February 8, Gene Munster, the managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss recent trends in the tech sector and the rise of FAANG stocks, particularly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here's what he had to say:

""They have the biggest upside potential relative to where expectations are... these three, I think, are largely unappreciated. I just wanna start with Meta. I think it's the biggest AI opportunity that's misunderstood. Most investors understand that Meta is using AI to improve ad campaigns, ad attribution... but there is a significant underappreciated lever that could take this into a whole different atmosphere. This theory comes from Deepwater's Doug Clinton. He believes that ultimately, they will monetize Llama. Llama is an opensource model. The other foundation models, Claude, and ChatGPT, and Gemini, they're all closed. Llama has 30 million downloads. If they monetize this, they will likely announce a cloud infrastructure... that is a whole new shift, and new benefit to Meta.""

On the rise of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, Munster said the following:

""Apple's gonna come out with their own foundation model likely in June, and they're gonna allow this to do personalized AI. This is really gonna capture 20% of the world's interest, and they can charge $10 a month for this.""

Most investors have been overlooking Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, but Munster thinks the company is on its way to benefitting from a new opportunity.

Biden Administration's Investment in Chips

In an additional boost for the tech sector, the Biden Administration has announced a $5 billion investment in chips, a move that is bound to uplift the semiconductor industry. On February 9, Ronnie Chatterji, professor at Duke University and former White House Chips Coordinator, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss this move. He noted that this move signals a partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure that the US continues to lead ""in the current generation of chips"" alongside the ""next generation."" The investment is thus being welcomed overwhelmingly and may signal greater things for semiconductor companies in 2024.

With the current situation being so overwhelmingly in favor of tech companies, we have compiled a list of the best FAANG stocks to buy now. These include some of the top American tech stocks to buy apart from the original FAANG stocks.

Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks

10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years

AAPL,2024-02-08,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported its fourth earnings last week. Although slumping demand for smartphones didn’t bring down its earnings, weak demand in China overshadowed its first sales growth in a year that came as a result of record service revenue. In addition, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) dethroned Apple as the world’s most valuable company in January as it hit the $3 trillion market capitalization while Apple’s slipped below this milestone. Microsoft also reported its strongest profit growth in more than two years as it continues to infuse AI across its business and offerings.

Fourth Quarter Highlights

Apple posted revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $117.91 billion. Apple also reported record earnings per share of $2.18, also topping $2.11 that analysts had predicted. Net income rose 13% to $34 billion.

Net iPhone sales grew almost 6% YoY to $69.7 billion while global iPad sales dropped to $7 billion, down from $9 billion reported for 2022’s comparable quarter.

While sales in Europe and Japan rose, revenue in China slumped 13% YoY to $20.8 billion. Demand in China has slowed more than expected in response to rising competition from Huawei as well as Beijing restriction on its products. According to Counterpoint Research, overall China smartphone sales grew 6.6% and although Apple maintained its leadership with 20.2% market share, its sales dropped 9% while Huawei experienced a sales rise of as much as 71%.

But the services segment that houses its App Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple TV, continues to be a rising star as its revenue grew 11% YoY to 23.1 billion.

The iPhone might no longer be the best indicator of Apple’s health...

Services were undoubtedly the star of the latest quarterly report that came one day after Apple’s biggest product launch in about a decade- the Vision Pro headset. Priced at $3,499, Apple spent an estimated $100 billion to develop this product it hopes to become the must-have piece of home electronics. More importantly, this product is the ultimate opportunity for Tim Cook to make his own Apple legacy.

Moreover, Apple splurged on its AppleTV+ content and it has scored it as many as 13 Academy Award nominations, with ten of them being for the Killers of The Flower Moon. But, this is kind of expected as Apple built its biggest movie industry bet with the all-time-great director, screenwriter and producer, Mr. Martin Scorsese.

Apple posted strong numbers and it showed that services continue to grow and become a bigger part of the tech giant’s business, but China is a lingering concern. In response to this slowdown in China, Apple even offered a rare discount for its latest iPhone in January. Cook also confirmed that generative AI software features are coming on Apple’s iOS and other platforms later this year, which is only to be expected considering that Microsoft, Google and Samsung’s latest figures were fueled by such enhancements. But considering that Apple is known for being secretive about its next moves, Cook’s confirmation and tease could mean that Apple’s AI plans are ambitious, to say the least. After all, there’s nothing artificial about AI and generative AI’s business potential nor the the latest figures that Microsoft and Google posted, and this is just the beginning of a new era that is in the making.

Small and medium-sized enterprises are increasingly adopting this technology to improve customer experiences and stay competitive in the market. Industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, retail, gaming, education, and automotive are actively embracing AR for training, maintenance, assistance, and monitoring purposes. The augmented reality market is expected to grow due to increased smartphone adoption and app integration, according to Fortune Business Insights. Moreover, key market players collaborating with 5G providers to address latency issues are anticipated to drive market growth. For example, in May 2022, Telstra Group Limited (ASX:TLS), an Australian telecommunications company, partnered with Google and Accenture to create a 5G-powered augmented reality experience at Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium. Such collaborations among major tech providers are likely to enhance the potential of AR in diverse innovative and immersive applications.

The AR market was valued at $42.20 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach $1.11 trillion by 2030, exhibiting a 50.7% compound annual growth rate. In 2022, the North American augmented reality market was valued at $13.72 billion. Key industry players like PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) offer different AR solutions. For instance, PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) provides products like Vuforia AR, Vuforia Studio, Vuforia Expert Capture, Vuforia Instruct, and Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, while Google LLC offers ARCore, an AR platform featuring cloud anchors, environmental HDR, and depth for digital objects.

In 2023, we witnessed the launch of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro, alongside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s premium VR device, targeted either as a creative tool or a luxury item due to its high price. This year might unveil Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s anticipated AR glasses. Different devices, like the Apple Glasses and Meta Quest Pro, will strive to offer unique experiences. Some will emphasize a sophisticated high-end encounter, while others will prioritize lightweight and simplicity, understanding that current headset sizes and weights deter adoption for many users. Online platforms enabling remote teamwork will evolve in 2024, aiming for increased immersion and practicality. Despite the popularity of remote work, certain aspects of in-person communication are challenging to replicate. Collaborative mixed reality tools are expected to utilize VR and AR more extensively, capturing and expressing the subtle nuances of interaction that are difficult to convey through video calls.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Tim Cook unveiled the ""Vision Pro,"" an augmented reality headset, during the WWDC event in June 2023. According to Cook, it represents a new kind of computer that enhances user experience through the most natural and intuitive methods. He likened its significance to the introduction of previous Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, suggesting that just as the Mac brought personal computing and the iPhone brought mobile computing, the Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing. The Vision Pro marks Apple's entry into a significant new product category, the first since 2015. Priced at $3,499, this headset seamlessly combines virtual and augmented reality. Historically, this market has been somewhat specialized, with Meta holding a dominant position. However, Apple aims to leverage advanced technology and its renowned marketing skills to elevate this sector. During the launch event at Apple's New York store, CEO Tim Cook highlighted the device's impressive interface, describing it as a ""magical way to control"" the headset. The Vision Pro utilizes eye movement and hand gestures for navigation, offering users immersive experiences. Cook draws parallels between the Vision Pro's debut and the launches of other iconic Apple devices, such as the Mac, iPod, and iPhone, emphasizing that it now stands among the groundbreaking products in Apple's history.

New entrants are creating a buzz in the augmented reality space. For example, Xreal, a maker of augmented reality glasses, is in the process of raising $60 million in funding, bringing its total funding to over $300 million and valuing the company at more than $1 billion. The CEO, Chi Xu, aims to stay ahead of competitors like Apple, Meta Platforms, and Google in the augmented reality space. Xreal, a Chinese startup, holds approximately 4% of the overall mixed reality market, with a significant presence in the AR-only devices sector. The funds will support the production of 2 million devices next year, with a target of going public in the United States within the next two years. The company anticipates generating $100 million to $150 million in revenue in 2024 and between $200 million and $300 million in 2025.

Although the augmented reality market is dominated by tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), we discuss AR stocks under $5 in this article.

Apple beats AliveCor antitrust lawsuit over heart-rate apps for Apple Watch

In This Article:

(Reuters) — Apple has persuaded a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit by a Silicon Valley startup accusing it of illegally monopolizing the US market for heart rate monitoring apps for its Apple Watch.

US District Judge Jeffrey White in Oakland, California, ruled on Tuesday against AliveCor, which had developed an app for detecting irregular heartbeats.

It had accused Apple of violating the federal Sherman antitrust law and a California unfair competition law.

The decision explaining White's reasoning is temporarily being kept under seal because of confidentiality concerns.

""AliveCor is deeply disappointed and strongly disagrees with the court's decision to dismiss our anti-competition case and we plan to appeal,"" the company said in a statement.

Apple said in a statement that the lawsuit challenged its ability to make improvements to the Apple Watch that consumers and developers rely on. ""Today's outcome confirms that is not anticompetitive,"" it said.

In an amended complaint, AliveCor said Apple had led it to believe it would collaborate on heart-monitoring technology for the Apple Watch, only to then copy its ideas and embark on a ""concentrated campaign to corner the market for heartrate analysis.""

The complaint also accused Apple of ""updating"" the heartrate algorithm for its watches, to prevent third parties from identifying irregular heartbeats and offering competing apps.

AliveCor had developed KardiaBand, a wristband for the Apple Watch capable of recording an electrocardiogram, or ECG.

The Mountain View, California-based company also developed the Kardia app for analyzing ECG readings on Apple Watches, and a SmartRhythm heartrate analysis app powered by artificial intelligence.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, has denied wrongdoing, and said competitors have no right to dictate its design decisions.

AliveCor is still litigating separate patent infringement claims against Apple.

The case is AliveCor Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 21-03958.

AAPL,2024-02-05,"In light of the above, it is unsurprising that major names such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continue to be considered some of the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts and investors alike. These companies are some of the best long-term tech stocks to invest in and have been dubbed the best tech stocks to buy for several years, all due to their stellar performance. But they have been joined by many other notable names, which our list below will highlight.

Our Methodology

We have selected the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts by using a stock screener to identify American tech stocks and then shortlisting the top stocks based on their upside potential according to Wall Street analysts. The stocks are ranked from the lowest to the highest upside potential as of February 5. We have also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock. Some leading companies, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), had to be excluded from our list because of their low upside potential.

Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts

Upslope Capital Management mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”

Gates bought approximately 52,815 shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the third quarter. The Microsoft co-founder joined the Apple bandwagon relatively late, as many billionaires already have significant exposure to the tech giant. Warren Buffett, one of the most influential investors of this generation, considers Apple to be one of his crown jewels, claiming the business is ""better than anything we own.""

Buffett has a 5.9% stake in Apple as he owns over 915 million shares, making it his largest portfolio holding. He last bought Apple shares in the first quarter of 2023.

Fisher increased his stake in Apple in the third quarter, scooping up over 878,000 shares. Apple is the largest holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 5.25% of its total portfolio.

Concerns regarding slowing demand for Apple's products have caused the stock to plummet this year. Given concerns regarding Apple's sales in China amid tensions between the U.S. and China, the tech giant has been strategically shifting its production base to India. The company aims to produce nearly 25% of its iPhones in the Southeast Asian country.

Bank of America upgraded Apple stock to Buy on Jan. 18, issuing a price target of $225. This indicates a potential upside of over 17%.

AAPL,2024-02-04,"The U.S. stock market rallied in 2023 despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive stance and concerns regarding an impending recession and growing geopolitical tensions. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index surged by over 43% in fiscal 2023, marking its best year since 2020. The broader S&P 500 index rose 24.2% last year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 14%. The Canadian S&P/TSX Exchange rose by nearly 8% last year.

The U.S. and Canadian equity markets' stellar performance, despite all odds, proved to be highly unprofitable for short sellers, who were betting on stocks to fall. According to S3 Partners Research, short sellers faced an ""exceedingly difficult year"" in 2023, losing approximately $194.9 billion. Bearish traders had a total short position of $957 billion in 2023, according to S3 Partners.

Banking Crisis

The U.S. regional banking crisis in early 2023, triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, was one of the most profitable periods for short sellers. Short sellers booked a profit of 840%, or $1.6 billion, on their bet against First Republic Bank, making it the most profitable bet placed by short sellers last.

The collapse of First Republic Bank marked the largest banking failure since 2008 and the second-largest in history. The bank was subsequently acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). Short interest increased tremendously during the height of the banking crisis, as short interest in First Republic increased to the range of between 7% and 37% by March 31, significantly above the average of between 3% and 5% for U.S. equities.

Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the second-most profitable investment bet made by short-sellers last year, while Signature Bank was the 11th most profitable.

“The shorts in the months before the collapse were accurately warning the markets...that the bank (SVB) was being dangerously mismanaged,” Better Markets President and CEO Dennis Kelleher wrote in an email to Reuters. “The problem is once that collapse happened, shorts with various motives started targeting other banks.”

Tech Rally Of 2023

Tech stocks, which witnessed a substantial rout in 2022, made a surprising comeback last year, catching short sellers off guard. Artificial intelligence (AI) was the game changer driving tech stocks last year, as Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI launched the viral generative AI platform ChatGPT, while chip maker Nvidia Corp.'s AI-focused chips gained traction.

The six major stocks that faced setbacks for short sellers, according to S3 Research Partners, include Tesla Inc., Nvidia, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc.

Short sellers lost the most money betting against Tesla, booking a collective loss of $12.2 billion in 2023. Short sellers lost more money on their Tesla bet than any other company last year, as the stock surged by nearly 102%. This is in stark contrast with 2022 when short sellers booked a net profit of over $15 billion as Tesla slumped by approximately 65% in fiscal 2022.

Trends In 2024

So far, 2024 has been tumultuous for the U.S. stock market, as equities have been fluctuating because of concerns regarding the timeline of interest rate cuts that the Federal Reserve signaled in December.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CHTR.

Strengths

Financial Resilience and Product Dominance: Apple's financial health remains robust, with an increase in net income to $33.916 billion, up from $29.998 billion in the previous year. This financial resilience is underpinned by the iPhone's continued dominance in the market, contributing significantly to the company's revenue. Apple's ability to maintain high-profit margins, particularly in its services segment, which saw an 11% increase in net sales, further solidifies its financial strength. The company's diversified product portfolio, including the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, complements the iPhone ecosystem, creating a comprehensive suite of products that drive customer loyalty and recurring revenue.

Innovation and Brand Equity: Apple's commitment to research and development, with expenses maintained at $7.696 billion, underscores its focus on innovation. The company's brand is synonymous with quality and innovation, which is reflected in its strong gross margin of $54.855 billion. Apple's brand equity is a competitive advantage that allows it to command premium pricing and maintain a loyal customer base. The introduction of new products, such as the updated MacBook Pro and iMac, demonstrates Apple's continuous effort to innovate and meet consumer demands.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Key Products: Despite its financial success, Apple's heavy reliance on the iPhone, which accounts for a significant portion of its revenue, poses a risk. Any disruption in the iPhone's market appeal or supply chain could have a substantial impact on the company's overall performance. Additionally, the decrease in iPad sales by 25% indicates potential vulnerabilities in Apple's product mix that need to be addressed to ensure sustained growth.

Supply Chain and Geopolitical Risks: Apple's supply chain is complex and global, with significant exposure to geopolitical risks and trade tensions, particularly in Greater China, where net sales decreased by 13%. The company's reliance on outsourcing partners and individual suppliers for components and manufacturing also presents operational risks that could affect its ability to deliver products efficiently and cost-effectively.

Opportunities

Services and Wearables Expansion: The growth in Apple's services and wearables segments presents significant opportunities. With an 11% increase in services net sales, Apple is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital content, cloud services, and subscription-based models. The wearables market also offers potential for expansion, despite a decrease in sales, as consumer interest in health and fitness technology continues to rise.

International Markets and New Technologies: Apple's performance in international markets, such as a 15% increase in Japan net sales, highlights the opportunity for further geographic expansion. Additionally, the company's investments in new technologies, such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence, could open up new revenue streams and strengthen its competitive position in the long term.

Threats

Competitive Pressure and Market Saturation: The technology industry is highly competitive, with rapid innovation and changing consumer preferences. Apple faces intense competition from other smartphone and technology manufacturers, which could erode its market share and pressure margins. Market saturation, particularly in mature markets, poses a challenge to growth, as most consumers already own smartphones and upgrade cycles lengthen.

Economic Uncertainties and Regulatory Changes: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation and currency fluctuations, can impact consumer spending and Apple's international sales. Regulatory changes, such as those related to privacy and antitrust concerns, could also force Apple to alter its business practices, potentially affecting its profitability and strategic direction.

In conclusion, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) exhibits a strong financial foundation and brand equity, driven by its flagship iPhone and a growing services segment. However, the company must navigate challenges such as product dependence, supply chain complexities, and competitive pressures. Opportunities for expansion in services, wearables, and international markets are countered by threats from market saturation and regulatory changes. Apple's strategic focus on innovation and customer experience positions it to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic tech landscape.

AAPL,2024-01-31,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at theHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.

Charles Paquelet is an American hedge fund manager who founded Skylands Capital in 2004. Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:

''Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,"" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.

In 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital. The fund had $661 million under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. You will see some of the top names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the fund's portfolio as well as spot under-the-radar small-cap names which could explode in the future.

Charles Paquelet's Investment Philosophy

Skylands Capital's investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to ""extrapolate"" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who ""can anticipate change before it is obvious.""

Value or Growth?

Charles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.

""It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important,"" the fund's website says.

Methodology

For this article we scanned Skylands Capital's Q3'2023 portfolio and picked its top ten technology stock picks. Why do we pay attention to what hedge funds are doing? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

10. Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,318,380

Skylands Capital bought a new stake in entertainment and games company Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund's stake in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was valued at $1.3 million as of the end of September 2023.

In December, Jefferies said it believes the gaming industry will see a slowdown in 2024 as gamers become more selective and prudent with their purchases. Jefferies said at the time that even though Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was expected to post 2025 guidance below expectations, its upcoming games like Battlefield, Sims, Skate and new Star Wars titles will ""re-accelerate topline and drive margin expansion.""

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA).

9. Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,406,860

Industrial technology company Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) ranks ninth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital owns a $1.41 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). Over the past one year the stock has gained about 50% in value.

Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 23 hedge funds had stakes in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) during this period was Chuck Royce's Royce & Associates which owns a $49 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT).

8. Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,433,715

Satellite technology company Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) ranks eighth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital, as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, owns a $2.4 million stake in Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM). Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a new stock pick of the hedge fund.

In November, Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) CEO Matthew J Desch bought 28,000 shares of Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) at $37.01 per share.

Baron Growth Fund made the following comment about Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a leading mobile voice and data communications services vendor offering global coverage via satellite. Shares fell on second quarter earnings, growth modestly slower than expected. Investors were also concerned by a potential slowdown in Iridium’s voice and data segment following several years during which the segment benefited from price increases and competition displacements. We attribute the earnings miss to a one-time write off of a spare satellite. This will not impact the company’s long-term prospects. We also remain excited about the potential benefit from Iridium’s recent partnership with Qualcomm to allow satellite connectivity on its new Snapdragon chips. While Iridium has suggested the realization of the direct-to-device opportunity might take longer than some investors had hoped, we believe the collaboration will yield substantial revenue for the company over time. We also remain excited about the company’s capital allocation program, which should benefit shareholders in the years ahead.”

7. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,612,316

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top tech stock picks of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet since his hedge fund Skylands Capital has a $2.6 million stake in the ecommerce retailer which is also a part of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that have gained a lot amid the AI boom.

UBS recently published a list of quality stocks it believes could outperform in 2024. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was part of the list. UBS said in its note that these Buy-rated stocks are in ""30% top for quality, have positive earnings momentum, are not crowded -- have a crowding data score better than 0.1 -- and have reasonable value without overly high beta.""

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the most popular technology stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 286 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”

6. SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $4,148,033

SaaS company SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) ranks sixth in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Charles Paquelet. Skylands Capital had a $4.1 million stake in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.

“Our bottom contributors in Q3 were all from our long book, including HCA Healthcare and SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC). SS&C Technologies, a provider of software and services to investment firms, brokerages and other financial institutions, has faced slower organic growth in recent quarters as its business units have produced inconsistent results. Further, rising costs have crimped margins — issues we believe will eventually stabilize but which we are monitoring closely. However, we believe the market is overly pessimistic about the company’s ability to improve its organic growth rate and its margins and are maintaining our position.”

AAPL,2024-01-31,"“On the plus side of the ledger, we had strong contributions from independent power producers Vistra and Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG). Both stocks surged with higher US electricity prices as strong summer demand exposed reliability issues in many regions of the nation’s electric grid. Meanwhile, Midwest focused Constellation is the biggest producer of carbon-free electricity in the US with nuclear power plants representing the majority of its capacity.

Our research identified an upside to earnings power from maturing hedges and regulatory changes, including the Inflation Reduction Act’s nuclear credit. A recent spinout from Exelon Corp, we viewed the strength of Constellation’s clean, reliable baseload power model as an appealing and high potential offering for residential and commercial customers.

Methodology

For this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26. From these stocks we picked 16 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

16. Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 23

Transportation services company Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In October Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) posted Q3 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $1.71, beating estimates by $0.01.

15. American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 42

With a dividend yield of 2% and a PE ratio of 13, insurance and financial solutions company American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds shows that 42 hedge funds had stakes in American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG).

Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Insurance company American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) was also among our top contributors. The company’s most recent operating results outperformed expectations, as it reported robust earnings with improving underwriting margins in the property and casualty business. AIG’s strategic initiatives also added to the positive sentiment. The company made further progress in separating its Life & Retirement unit by selling additional shares via a secondary offering. Furthermore, AIG announced the sale of its reinsurance business to RenaissanceRe at an attractive valuation, a move that will further reduce volatility in AIG’s continuing operations.”

14. Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 42

Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) is one of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Earlier this month, Wolfe Research upgraded Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) along with some other semiconductor stocks as it becomes ""incrementally more bullish"" on analog circuits.

""We stayed neutral on analog for too long this cycle, since stocks bottomed an unprecedented full year before fundamentals began to deteriorate,"" Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note.

Here is what Weitz Conservative Allocation Fund has to say about Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“We added a new position in Microchip Technology, Inc., (NASDAQ:MCHP) to the Fund during the quarter. Microchip is a leading provider of mixed signal microcontrollers and analog semiconductors to a broad range of industrial, data center, automotive, communication and consumer appliance customers. The company enjoys favorable product characteristics that help drive strong profitability, and it benefits from several long-wave demand tailwinds such as electronification, automation, and growth in data communications. While Microchip is not immune from semiconductor cycles, its cash flows have been durable through cycles. The multi-year outlook is solid, and we think the company is poised to further boost per-share value growth through increasing share repurchases at discounted prices.

13. Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 44

HR and payroll solutions company Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) ranks 13th in our list of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to smart money investors. Earlier this month Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) declared a $0.89 per share dividend, in line with the previous dividend. Paychex Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PAYX) board also approved to buy back up to $400 million of its common stock beginning February 1, 2024 and expiring on May 31, 2027.

Ensemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) (3.71% weight in the Fund): While employment growth was strong in 2023, the Fed’s efforts to moderate job growth was successful. Paychex business is driven by the number of employees on the payrolls of its small to medium size business customers. With recession worries percolating all year, the stock was flat on a year to date basis in late October just as the economic outlook began to brighten. As recession worries faded the stock rallied to gains of as much as 13% in the fourth quarter. But in the late December earnings report, the company said that core payroll services growth would be a bit weaker than investors expected. Despite this, the company slightly raised full year earnings guidance as demand for their full service solution that incorporates human resources services beyond payroll improved. The stock finished the quarter up 4.1%.”

12. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 48

In December, Morgan Stanley published a list of 32 stocks with high free cash flow, high earnings per share growth, and an overweight rating in its U.S. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) made it to the list.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 48 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) during this period was Paul Singer's Elliott Management which owns a $1.7 billion stake in Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC).

11. Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 53

Oppenheimer recently started covering Builders FirstSource with an Outperform rating. Here is what the firm said about Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):

“The company has a market-leading position in a fragmented industry and should benefit from our optimistic view of single-family housing starts in 2024. Growth in value-added products increases the amount of revenue tied to services and is a positive for gross margin and returns.”

Over the past one year Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) shares have gained about 124%.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Bonhoeffer Capital Management stated the following regarding Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):

“Over the past 12 months, interest rates have been increasing, which has reduced the economics of this strategy; but a large spread still exists if assets can be purchased at the right price. Increasing interest rates has affected the returns on public LBO firms. Some firms, like Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) (described below), have reacted to higher interest rates by moderating their use of debt in their expansion plans.

10. Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 55

With a dividend yield of 3.7% and a low PE ratio, Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a notable member of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF portfolio. The stock is up about 3.9% over the past six months.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management which owns a $358 million stake in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD).

In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD):

“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”

9. Target Corp (NYSE:TGT)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 58

US retailer Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is a key part of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF. The stock has a dividend yield of over 3% and had 58 hedge fund investors as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.

Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is also among the stocks Morgan Stanley is recommending for 2024.

Like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), hedge funds are also buying Target.

In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT):

“Other meaningful moves during the quarter included additions to cyclical growers we consider early cycle consumer plays: Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), a position initiated in the third quarter, and Estee Lauder. As earnings start to recover, these stocks and semiconductors tend to be among the first to move. We may be a little early and could see some choppiness in stock prices as job growth and consumer spending cool due to the lagged effects of Fed tightening, but we believe we’re closer to the bottom in terms of economic activity and that both companies, as well as Union Pacific, are well-positioned to benefit as consumer sentiment improves and the economy begins to recover.”

8. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 64

Piper Sandler recently said in a report that Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares have ""reversed"" a downtrend and the investment firm expects more upside to the stock.

Piper Sandler mentioned this in its Technical Research report on SMID Momentum. Piper Sandler said:

“We are optimistic about equities with the (SPX), (INDU), and (NDX) hitting record highs, but waning market breadth is a notable concern. We saw some signs of rotation yesterday as SMID-caps began rallying out of their three-week pullbacks.”

Oakmark Fund made the following comment about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

7. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 65

Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) ranks seventh in our list of the most undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Bristol-Myers has a dividend yield of about 4.8% and its biggest shareholder as of the end of the third quarter of 2023 was John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $384 million stake.

Out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 65 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY).

In addition to BMY, hedge funds are also piling into Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and The Walt Disney Company. We added Texas Instruments as a new position. Bristol-Myers has been dealing with the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid, one of its key products. Although the company is launching new drugs in melanoma, heart failure, and psoriasis it will need additional products to offset the lower revenue in Revlimid.”

6. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 65

Earlier in January, BofA listed its Efficient Growth Index top members for 2023’s fourth quarter in its RIC Report. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was part of the list of stocks mentioned in the report.

AAPL,2024-01-29,"In a recent incident, an iPhone user managed to recover their stolen device from an EcoATM kiosk at Walmart Inc., thanks to Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""Find My"" app’s location tracking feature.

What Happened: A user posted on Reddit that their iPhone 15 was stolen at their workplace. The thief turned off the device, making it untraceable. Assuming the phone was lost for good, the user settled their old phone’s dues and bought a new one.

The next day, the “Find My” app started displaying the phone’s changing locations. Eventually, the device’s location was traced to a nearby Walmart. The user and a friend went to the store and began looking for the phone.

The stolen iPhone was finally found in Walmart's EcoATM kiosk, which purchases used phones for cash. After contacting the local police, the user retrieved the device from the machine.

Why It Matters: This incident underscores the effectiveness of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) “Find My” app, despite previous reports of it leading iPhone owners on a wild goose chase. In April 2023, multiple iPhone owners were led to a single Texas address due to alleged faulty Maps data.

The utility of the “Find My” feature extends beyond iPhones. In June 2023, Apple announced an iOS 17 update that made it easier to locate a misplaced Apple Watch using the Control Center.

How To Enable ‘Find My' On iPhone

Open the Settings app and tap your name.

Tap Find My, and if you want to inform your friends and family about your location, enable Share My Location.

Now, tap and enable Find My iPhone.

You can also find your iPhone even when it's offline by enabling ""Find My network.""

Make sure you have enabled Location Services on your iPhone to be able to locate your device on a map.

AAPL,2024-01-27,"The Apple iPad has turned 14. Launched on Jan. 27, 2010, the iPad was subject to jokes before becoming a category-defining product.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder and then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPad as a ""magical and revolutionary device"" that could do everything from browsing the web, sending and receiving emails, reading books and playing games, among other things.

A ‘Magical' Device

""iPad is our most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price,"" Jobs said, adding that it would create an ""entirely new category of devices.""

Over the next decade and a half, Jobs was proven right and Apple capitalized on the first-mover advantage — one in two tablets being used worldwide is an iPad, according to data from Statcounter.

Apple put the iPad on sale for the first time on Apr. 3, 2010 and ended up selling over 300,000 units in just one day.

Jobs announced the iPad 2 in March 2011, and revealed that Apple sold 15 million iPads in the first nine months of it going on sale.

Apple has since launched 10 generations of the iPad and, apart from the standard variant, announced Mini, Air and Pro variants.

iPad Is Not Apple's First Tablet

A little fun fact: Did you know the iPad was not Apple's first tablet? Under John Sculley's leadership, Apple launched a tablet-like device called the Newton MessagePad.

""What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes,"" Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said in a 1983 speech.

However, the Newton MessagePad was not well received and was discontinued by Jobs.

Let’s look at how Apple stock has fared since the company launched the iPad 14 years ago.

Apple stock price from Jan. 27, 2010, till today

Apple’s stock, adjusted for stock splits and other corporate actions, was $7.4243 on Jan. 27, 2010.

Its stock price today is $194.17, which is an increase of 2,515% during this period.

Value of a $1,000 investment in Apple stock, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices, respectively, from Jan. 27, 2010, till today

If you had invested $1,000 in Apple stock on Jan. 27, 2010, today, you would have $26,153.

Likewise, if you had invested $1,000 in an index fund replicating Nasdaq, you would have $6,982.

A similar $1,000 investment in an index fund that replicates the S&P 500 would be worth $4,459.

A Multi-billion Dollar Business

Since the iPad's release in 2010, Apple has launched a few other products like the Apple Watch, AirPods, and, more recently, Vision Pro.

Apple's iPads alone made the company over $28 billion in its FY23, accounting for 7.4% of the company’s topline.

Apple has since expanded the use case for iPads from simple reading and entertainment devices to something that can be used by creators as well. The iPad Pro models are tailored for productivity and creation, sporting a large, high-resolution display and featuring powerful M-series chipsets.

AAPL,2024-01-25,"REX Shares is boosting the distribution rate of FEPI, its only exchange-traded fund, which has pulled in millions from investors since it launched in October with a strategy similar to JPMorgan’s popular JEPI.

The $37.6 million REX FANG & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF (FEPI) will distribute $1.20 a share to holders, a nearly 26% rate, the company announced yesterday. That’s up from previous distributions of $1.18 and $1.15.

Boosting the payout comes as investors have more than doubled FEPI’s assets under management this year, adding $26.5 million to the fund that’s experienced next to zero in outflows, according to etf.com data. The far larger, $31 billion JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), which also follows a covered call strategy, has been boosting its dividend, from 29 cents a share in August to about 43 cents in December.

A covered call ETF strategy intends to generate income for investors, in which they sell call options on a security they own in exchange for a premium. The premium received from selling the call option provides additional income for the investor.

FEPI Holds Gaining Netflix Shares

Investing in volatile tech stocks may boost income, and FEPI’s top holdings include Palo Alto Networks Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Apple Inc. The fund also holds Netflix Inc., whose stock jumped today after reporting positive quarterly results.

“The more volatile the underlying stocks, the more income you can generate by writing calls,” etf.com senior analyst Sumit Roy said. “That's good for FEPI.”

While FEPI has gained 3.3% this month, the broader tech stock ETF Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) has added 4.7%.

“The trade-off is you give up some upside if the underlying stocks go up a lot, which they have been doing recently,” Roy said

Covered call ETFs hold $56.1 billion in 263 U.S. traded funds, according to etf.com data. They’ve attracted $65 billion in net inflows over the past three years, Morningstar analysts wrote in a Jan. 22 note.",0.24792663476874,0.5216905901116428,Positive,0.843477725982666,0.4783430819845715
AAPL,2024-01-24,"The Magnificent Seven tech stocks, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), are again driving the stock market’s surge.

These tech giants, known for their stellar performance last year, have returned 4.4% this month, outperforming the S&P 500.

Investors are flocking to tech stocks, with approximately $4 billion poured into tech funds in the past two weeks, marking the most significant inflow since August, the Wall Street Journal reports.

In 2023, these seven stocks collectively doubled in value, adding a staggering $5.1 trillion to their market capitalization.

Among these tech giants, Nvidia is a critical player in the ongoing tech-driven rally.

The company’s success is closely linked to the surging demand for semiconductor chips, especially those used to power artificial intelligence (AI) programs.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), a significant supplier for semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, recently announced its expected 20% revenue growth for the year.

Analysts remained bullish on Nvidia, citing improving PCs, AI deep learning, and inferencing markets now with generative AI tailwinds, gaming trends, automotive, and data centers.

The Big Tech stocks remain invested in ramping up their AI capabilities. Analysts have voiced $1 trillion in AI-driven opportunity for Nvidia being the frontrunner in GPU and chip supply.

This growing demand is a critical factor in the resurgence of these tech stocks and the broader stock market.

While the Magnificent Seven tech stocks have been performing well, it’s important to note that their returns this year, although impressive, have not reached the levels seen in the previous January.

Despite the slightly more modest outlook, Wall Street analysts recommend these stocks, projecting an average return of 8.6% for the group over the next 12 months.

AAPL,2024-01-24,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to release earnings results for its fiscal first quarter, after the closing bell on Feb. 1, 2024.

Analysts expect the iPhone maker to report quarterly earnings at $2.10 per share on revenue of $118.03 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Apple has requested a U.K. tribunal to dismiss a lawsuit worth close to $1 billion. The lawsuit, brought forth by over 1,500 app developers, alleges that Cupertino imposes unfair App Store charges.

The company also launched its newest iPhone software update, iOS 17.3, and it comes with several innovative features.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.49%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).

To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).

Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares

So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,219,875 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.

Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $243,975 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).

Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).

Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.

Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) is one of the most shorted stocks in the EV space amid fears regarding production and uncertainty in 2024 due to upcoming elections. Earlier this month, the stock fell to an all-time low after Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) said it produced 2,391 vehicles during the last quarter of 2023 and delivered 1,734 vehicles, better than the analyst estimates for 1,696 vehicles delivered.

11. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 18

As US presidential elections 2024 inch closer, investors are starting to closely watch EV companies as a new government in the US could make or break EV stocks amid new policies. Analysts believe if Republicans come into power and make policies unfriendly to US EV companies, it would bode well for Chinese EV companies like Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) which would also plan faster expansion in other markets.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) during this period was Jos Shaver's Electron Capital Partners which owns a $38 million stake in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO).

10. Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 34

Brazilian mining giant Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) ranks 10th in our list of the top buzzing stocks to buy now. The stock is moving after Bloomberg reported that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants his former finance minister to be the next CEO of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).

In December, Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) disclosed that its iron ore production of 310M-320M metric tons in 2024 will be flat when compared to 2023.

A total of 34 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE). The biggest stakeholder of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) during this period was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $243 million stake in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).

Miller Value Partners Income Strategy made the following comment about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) fell during the quarter with iron ore prices. The company reported 1Q23 revenue of $8.44B, -22.7% Y/Y, below consensus of $8.79B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.69B, compared to 1Q22 EBITDA of $6.55B, below consensus of $4.49B. The Brazilian miner produced 66.8 million tons (Mt) of iron ore in 1Q23, +5.8% Y/Y, below consensus of 67.7 Mt, 67.0 thousand tons (kt) of copper, +18.4% Y/Y, and 41.0 kt of nickel, -10.5% Y/Y. Although management reaffirmed its FY23 production guidance, analysts seemed to be concerned by the negatively offsetting impacts of weaker iron ore prices as China, the world’s largest iron ore buyer, has threatened to curb any “unreasonable” price gains for the metal in an effort to prevent this year’s steel output from exceeding 2022 levels. Vale generated 1Q23 free cash flow (FCF) of $2.28B, bringing trailing-twelve month (TTM) FCF to $6.73B, or a FCF yield of 11.3%. The company repurchased $763MM worth of shares in the quarter and paid $1.80B in dividends, bringing total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter to $2.56B, or 4.3% of the company’s market cap.”

9. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43

Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) ranks ninth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Earlier this month Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) posted domestic Q4 sales volumes, with record electric vehicle (EV) numbers. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) sold 25,937 EVs in the period, a growth of 24% on a YoY basis.

8. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 52

AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) is buzzing as investors get ready to see the company's fourth quarter earnings report. Earlier in the month Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $21 price target.

Oppenheimer's analysts see several tailwinds for the stock, including AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) 120MHz C-Band portfolio which now covers over 200M point of presence, or POPs. Oppenheimer said that about 60% of AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) subscribers are now fiber, which means healthier margins and pricing leverage.

In addition to AT&T, other stocks trending right now include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). AT&T is one of the most buzzing stocks to buy right now popular among hedge funds.

Miller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.

7. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 70

Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is creating a buzz as investors get ready to receive Intel Corp's (NASDAQ:INTC) earnings report slated to be released on January 25. Recently, a Gartner report said Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) ranked first in the list of top semiconductor companies in 2023, with a total semiconductor revenue of $48.7 billion.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The most significant stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is owned by William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management which owns a $468 million stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel ranks fifth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.

Upslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”

6. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 81

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are creating a buzz on the Wall Street as investors await Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings that are set to be announced on January 24. The stock also came in the limelight after Elon Musk expressed his desire to have about 25% voting control over Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in order to make Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) a leader in AI and robotics. Tesla ranks sixth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Like Tesla, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also trending.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have gained about 47% over the past one year. Some analysts expect Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings to come in weaker than expected amid pricing wars in the EV sector.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Tsai Capital Corporation stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”

AAPL,2024-01-22,"Tech giant Apple Inc. has entered the virtual reality (VR) competition with the recent announcement of its new product Vision Pro. Set to be available for preorders in February, the unveiling of this cutting-edge device marks a significant milestone for Apple.

Apple experienced a remarkable 45% stock price rise last year, but shares are about flat to start 2024, fortunate to even bounce back after two prominent analyst downgrades. Coming off a 2.8% year-over-year decline in revenue in 2023, Apple will need to sell and execute its future.

This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?

Management is betting big on VR to get it there. Apple CEO Tim Cook has long been known as an operational genius, not a product genius, which makes this technological innovation potentially legacy-defining.

With this new hot product, the spotlight is now on Apple, and the question looms whether Vision Pro can give a boost to its sales to justify its roughly 30 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

The Vision Pro, priced at $3,499, is positioning itself as a high-end competitor in the market. This places it at seven times the cost of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset priced at $500.

The significant price difference raises questions about the features and capabilities that justify Vision Pro’s premium positioning compared to Meta’s offering. Price was called out by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg, who reportedly said Apple's vision is ""not the one [he] wants.""

Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), a key and established player in the VR space, introduced its first virtual-reality headset, the Oculus Quest, in 2019. Its latest release, the Quest 3, hit the market in October, further intensifying competition in the VR sector.

AAPL,2024-01-19,"In April 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched the first Apple computer, marking the beginning of what would become a technology powerhouse. At age 21, Jobs sold his Volkswagen bus for $1,500, while Wozniak sold his Hewlett-Packard calculator for $500. Together, the sales provided the funds for their initial venture​​.

With this capital, Jobs and Wozniak embarked on producing the Apple I, introduced on April Fools Day in 1976. Their innovative approach soon paid off. A local computer dealer placed a substantial order for 100 units for $50,000, a significant milestone for the fledgling company. To meet this demand, they purchased parts on credit, giving them a tight timeframe of one month to fulfill the order. Leveraging the support of family and friends, they completed the order, earning their first revenue and narrowly managing to pay off the parts suppliers with just a day to spare.

Jobs and Wozniak's ingenuity continued to fuel Apple Inc.’s growth. They later met Armas Clifford ""Mike"" Markkula, a former manager at Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. and Intel Corp., who played a crucial role in the company’s development. Markkula assisted in crafting a business plan and invested $92,000, in addition to helping arrange a $250,000 credit line. This financial support was instrumental in Apple’s first hit product.

The Apple I, marketed for $666.66 each, earned the company around $774,000. Following the launch of the Apple II, Apple’s sales skyrocketed to $139 million, three years after its release.

The pivotal moment for Apple came in 1980 when it became a publicly traded company. On its first day of trading, Apple’s market value reached $1.2 billion. By the end of the day, the market capitalization stood at $1.8 billion, a remarkable achievement considering the company started in Jobs' garage.

However, the journey was not without its challenges. Apple faced significant design flaws in its subsequent products, leading to recalls and consumer disappointment. This period saw IBM surpass Apple in sales, compelling Apple to compete in an IBM/PC-dominated market.

In 1983, Jobs recruited John Sculley from Pepsi-Cola to be CEO of Apple. The following year, they released the Macintosh, marketing it as part of a counterculture lifestyle. Despite its positive sales and superior performance to IBM's PCs, the Macintosh struggled with compatibility issues with IBM systems.

Because of internal disagreements and strategic differences, Jobs was eventually phased out of the company he co-founded and left Apple in 1985.

Jobs returned to Apple as CEO in 1997. He played a pivotal role in reviving the company, which was facing financial turmoil and was said to be on the verge of bankruptcy.

Over the years, Apple transformed from a personal computer company to a leader in cutting-edge digital products. By the time of Jobs’ death in 2011, Apple had achieved a market value of $391 billion, a testament to his vision, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.

Investors across the globe are increasingly drawn to stocks that provide regular dividends as a strategy to secure a steady income stream. To enhance wealth accumulation, opting for investments in global dividend companies presents an advantageous approach. When investors choose global dividend companies, they are essentially selecting businesses with a widespread international presence. These companies have proven themselves capable of generating profits on a global scale, often demonstrating resilience across different markets and economic conditions. By diversifying investments across such globally positioned firms, investors not only gain exposure to a variety of industries but also mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stand out as notable examples of robust dividend-paying entities that boast a strong and influential global footprint.

In 2022, global dividends experienced substantial growth, registering an impressive 8.4% increase to reach a historic high of $1.56 trillion, in line with the projections outlined by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. This growth was marked by record payouts in 12 countries, and a notable 88% of companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts. However, the momentum in global dividends took a downturn in 2023. This decline was attributed to reduced special dividends and a limited number of corporations implementing significant cuts to investor remuneration. Although the comprehensive data for the entire year is yet to be disclosed, the third-quarter report from Janus Henderson revealed a 0.9% decrease in global dividends to $421.9 billion during that period. As a consequence of these developments, there was a slight adjustment to the 2023 dividend forecast, with the estimate revised to $1.63 trillion from the previous projection of $1.64 trillion. Despite this marginal reduction, the forecasted figure still represents a record-breaking amount, showcasing a 4.4% increase from the global dividends recorded in 2022.",0.1782709750566893,0.3320922728065584,Positive,0.998219072818756,0.4539655556909717

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC projected on Thursday more than 20% growth in 2024 revenue on booming demand for high-end chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications even as the broader industry deals with weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc and Nvidia supplier, said at an earnings conference that AI represented a major opportunity

""We are a key enabler for AI applications. So far today, everything you saw for AI comes from TSMC,"" CEO C.C. Wei said at the conference, after the company reported a fourth quarter net profit that beat market expectations.

For advanced packaging, demand was very strong and TSMC can't offer enough capacity to support customers, which will continue to next year, he added.

But Wei said that for the industry overall, he was worried about over-capacity for mature nodes.

""There might be too much capacity being built right now for mature nodes. So the concern on over-capacity is valid,"" he said, though he added that it was not a concern for TSMC due to strong customer demand for its speciality technologies.

Looking ahead, TSMC said it plans to expand its global manufacturing footprint, with construction at its fab plant in Germany expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, while TSMC is still deciding on what technology node to build at a second fab in Arizona.

A first fab in Japan will open next month with volume production in the fourth quarter, while the company was also exploring building a second factory in the country.

It forecast capital spending at $28-$32 billion for this year, in line with 2023, and said it will also expand production at home in Taiwan.

TSMC said it is evaluating building a third fab in the southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung, and if it goes ahead all three fabs there will be for advanced 2 nanometre chips, due to strong demand driven by high performance computing and smartphones.

TSMC posted a 19% drop in net profit for the October-December quarter to T$238.7 billion ($7.6 billion) from a particularly strong year-earlier quarter.

The profit, though, beat a T$226.4 billion LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.

""Our fourth quarter business was supported by the continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology,"" said Wendell Huang, TSMC's chief financial officer.

He said the current quarter would be impacted by seasonality of the smartphone business, which would be partially offset by strength in its high-performance computing segment that includes AI chips.

While the company said 2023 was challenging, it forecast solid growth for this year, adding that it expects inventories to return to a healthy level.

Revenue for 2024 should increase in the low to mid-20% range in U.S. dollar terms, it said.

AAPL,2024-01-17,"The stock market has rebounded from a weak start to the year, with the benchmark S&P 500 index rising by over 1.8% over the past five days. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index has fared better as the tech rally resumes momentum, gaining over 3% in the second trading week of 2024.

As the inflation levels slow, the Federal Reserve is poised to begin cutting interest rates from March, which should boost equities. According to the FedWatch tool, the federal funds futures forecast a 79% probability of a rate cut in March. The declining borrowing costs should allow growth stocks to gain momentum in the upcoming months.

With lingering recession concerns and geopolitical tensions, investing in large-cap growth stocks can allow investors to capitalize on the expected bull run without assuming too much risk amid the tumultuous market backdrop.

Microsoft Corp.

Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is on track to become the world's largest company in terms of market cap, as its shares rose by over 5% last week to hit a market capitalization of $2.89 trillion, surpassing Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) $2.87 trillion market cap.

Microsoft's strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence (AI) drove the tech behemoth's growth over the past year, as its stake in OpenAI paid off tremendously.

“With co-pilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere,” Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in an earnings release. “We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers.""

Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard Inc. in a historic merger, allowing the former to become the third-largest gaming company in terms of revenue. Wall Street analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to rise by over 14% year over year to $243.8 billion in fiscal 2024. In addition, the consensus annual earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $11.24 indicates an 11.6% improvement year over year.

Eli Lilly and Co.

Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY), one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the U.S., recently made headlines as its weight-loss drug Zepbound went viral shortly after its launch in November. The weekly prescription demand for Zepbound crossed 25,000 per week by the end of December, surpassing the current supply level for the drug.

Amid supply shortage concerns, Eli Lilly plans to build a new factory in Germany while expanding its facility in North Carolina.

Analysts expect Eli Lilly's financials to improve significantly as the demand for Zepbound remains strong. The consensus revenue estimate of $8.5 billion for the fiscal first quarter ending in March indicates a 22.1% rise year over year. The company's EPS is expected to increase by over 54% year over year to $2.51 in the ongoing quarter.

Shares of Eli Lilly have been one of the best-performing pharma stocks over the past year, surging by over 77%.

Nvidia Corp.

Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock with its shares rising by more than 220% over the past year. The relatively new chip manufacturer made its name by capitalizing on the AI boom, designing chips catering to AI-related tasks.

Nvidia's chips hold an 85% market share in the artificial intelligence sector, making it the industry leader with a substantial competitive advantage. Shares of Nvidia have risen by nearly 10.5% so far this year.

As the AI boom gains traction, Nvidia is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing companies in the near term. The company's dominant market position has allowed it to maintain robust demand in international markets as well — China keeps buying Nvidia chips despite growing geopolitical tensions with the U.S.

Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to rise 231.8% year over year to $20.08 billion in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ending in January. In addition, the consensus EPS estimate of $4.5 for the current quarter indicates a 411.4% rise from the same period last year.

AAPL,2024-01-13,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and Top 11 Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and His Top 5 Stock Picks.

Jim Cramer kicked off 2024 with an observation that the market might be undergoing a rotation where investors are taking profits from major mega-cap tech stocks and pouring these profits into the laggards of 2023 like banks, healthcare and consumer companies.

What Jim Cramer's 'Crystal Ball' Says About 2024

Jim Cramer said that according to his ""crystal ball,"" investors this year would take profits selling ""best of the best"" and invest in companies that ""haven’t gotten respect for ages."" By best of the best Cramer meant the Magnificent Seven group of stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and ""richly valued"" software companies.

Cramer talked about his early days in the Wall Street where the beginning of every new year would bring excitement and enthusiasm among investors that caused ""repositioning"" in the market. Cramer said that most of the times this repositioning is temporary and does not have a lot of importance in the long run. Cramer said that some circles believe the Magnificent Seven group of stocks won't be able to sustain their rally. Cramer said he reluctantly agrees with this notion but long-term investors should approach these sell-offs as buying opportunities.

""A Heck With These Traders""

Cramer predicted that 2024 markets would be defined by what the Fed does about inflation as traders will keep looking over their shoulder for the next inflation report and Jerome Powell's comments. But Cramer advised his viewers to ""don’t be one of those people,"" referring to investors who impulsively react to any ""utterances"" from the Fed, traders, economists or politicians about the stock market.

Cramer expressed his frustration with this short-term, reactive investing approach and said:

""Me? I say a heck with these traders.""

Cramer Says AI and Software Bubbles Will Pop

Jim Cramer said during beginning of every new year investors usually sell stocks that perform extremely well in the previous year and invest their money into beaten down stocks. But that trend changes after earnings season begins and investors come back to top performers of the previous year. Jim Cramer predicted that the artificial intelligence and enterprises software ""bubbles will be popped."" But once these stocks come back to reasonable valuations compared to other stocks they will once again be bought, Cramer thinks.

Jim Cramer went through different sectors to weigh options for investors. For the healthcare sector, Cramer said ""no thank you"" since he believes healthcare stocks do not perform well during election years. For retail, Cramer said these companies are ""finally getting their arms around the shoplifting problem"" and could produce better returns. For the oil industry, Cramer said ""very difficult"" since ""we produce so much crude in this country"" that it's hard for oil prices to go higher.

Wait for the Sell-Off and Then Do ""Some Buying""

Jim Cramer said he told his investing club members that they'll be ""rewarded"" if they bought stocks with decent valuations, not dramatically expensive when compared to average S&P 500 multiples. Cramer said investors should be patient and wait for the sell-off he's expecting and then do ""some buying.""

Sound Shore Management made the following comment about GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“That said, current macro factors of higher inflation, rising rates, and a slowing economy are affecting stock prices in the short-term. Against this backdrop, many consumer stocks and financing-based business models declined in the third quarter. For example, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) was our largest detractor for the period. A recent spinout from GE, the company is the world’s largest medical imaging supplier with steady growth and higher margins. We purchased the stock in the first quarter of 2023 when it was trading at 14 times normalized earnings, a significant discount to peers. Our research concluded that GEHC’s profit margins were temporarily depressed due to the spinoff and one-time Research & Development charges, and that management’s plan for improvement was credible. The stock got off to a strong start early in the year, but returned the bulk of its gains as higher borrowing rates for their customers created demand uncertainty. As well, 15% of GE Healthcare’s business is from China, where demand has slowed along with the economy. We view these headwinds as temporary, and added to our position during the stock’s recent pullback.”

6. Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM)

AAPL,2024-01-10,"Panasonic Holdings Corp (OTC: PCRFF) (OTC: PCRFY) and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) have teamed up to create smart televisions, integrating Amazon's Fire TV streaming technology.

The companies revealed the venture at the CES 2024 event in Las Vegas, featuring an OLED model set to launch in Japan and Europe this spring.

Panasonic Entertainment & Communication, a subsidiary specializing in TVs and cameras, is collaborating with Amazon to develop the software for these TVs, the Nikkei Asia reports.

The Smart TVs will recommend content based on individual viewing habits, considering streaming services, broadcast TV, and previously recorded shows.

The companies proposed enhancing the personalized approach by creating separate accounts for each family member, analyzing their specific viewing patterns, and searching keywords.

Initial models will require manual account selection, but Panasonic plans to incorporate voice and fingerprint recognition in future versions for automatic user identification.

The company also aims to synchronize these TVs with in-vehicle displays, allowing the continuation of content from home to car, and with smartphones to analyze app-based video consumption for more precise content recommendations.

In 2022, global shipments of flat-screen TVs saw a 5% decline, dropping to 203 million units, influenced by reduced pandemic demand and a challenging global economy.

According to data from the U.K. research company Omdia, this market shift places South Korean and Chinese manufacturers like Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) and Hisense at the forefront, collectively holding over 60% of the global market share, Nikkei Asia writes.

Despite this competitive landscape, Panasonic has a modest 1% share in the worldwide TV market.

Also this week, Amazon launched Matter Casting. This new feature competes with Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) AirPlay, enabling iPhone and Android users to wirelessly stream videos to Amazon's TV devices like Fire TV units and Echo Show 15.

This innovation is part of Amazon's push for interoperable services. Initially, Matter Casting will focus on streaming content from Amazon's Prime Video app to Echo Show devices.

The production of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones in India has reached a groundbreaking level, exceeding INR 1 trillion ($13.5 billion) last year. According to data, obtained by the Indian daily Economic Times, iPhones valued at INR 650 billion ($8.8 billion) were exported from January to December.

An insider with knowledge of the production process explained, ""The [INR 1 trillion] figure denotes the freight on board (FOB) value as the products leave the factory. After factoring in taxes and dealer margins in various countries, the market value could range from INR 1.5 trillion ($20.3 billion) to INR 1.7 trillion ($23 billion).""

FOB refers to the cost of the goods as they depart the factory, excluding taxes and other charges. Apple's impressive performance has surpassed the targets set under India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, possibly earning the company's contract manufacturers additional rewards according to the scheme's financial provisions.

This milestone highlights the Indian government's efforts to shift global supply chains from China to India.

Apple has notably become one of India's leading mobile phone manufacturers by market value. The technology juggernaut has boosted its market share in India from 2% in FY18 to 6% in FY23, as reported by Counterpoint. During this period, Apple’s revenues in India soared to INR 493.22 billion ($6.7 billion) from INR 130.97 billion ($1.8 billion). In contrast, despite a decrease in market share, Samsung's mobile revenues grew to INR 703 billion ($9.5 billion) from INR 373 billion ($5 billion).

Apple is also nurturing a strong network of Indian suppliers, such as a unit of the Tata Group, further strengthening its shift away from China.

Technology stocks, especially the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, absolutely rocked in 2023 thanks to the AI-fueled rally. While the enthusiasm around AI is just getting started, many analysts believe in 2024 the broader market gains enjoyed by tech stocks last year will expand to other sectors while mega-cap tech stocks will take a back seat. Delano Saporu, Founder and CEO of New Street Advisors Group, while talking to CNBC earlier this month said that Magnificent Seven stocks are expected to take a breather in 2024 while market gains will broaden out to other sectors.

Recently, Jim Cramer also talked about his forecasts for 2024 and said that there is a market rotation going on right now in which money managers are taking profits by selling major technology stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and investing this money into other sectors like financials, healthcare and small-cap companies which remained on the back burner in 2023.

David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, also thinks that Magnificent Seven stocks are not expected to always outperform and investors should look beyond these stocks in 2024. Discussing his portfolio performance on CNBC, Katz said over the past two years Magnificent Seven stocks on average are up just about 8%. He said that for 2024 he’s expecting the laggards of 2023 to “catch up.”

In this backdrop, it’s important to take a look at some of the top non-tech stocks that have been posting high revenue growth over the past few months and years.

We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”

Shares surged following a significant top- and bottom-line earnings beat, as stronger than anticipated consumer demand is driving a record WAVE season. Forward booking trends are also ahead of historical ranges at record pricing. These factors combined with further improvement in onboard spend and solid cost containment led management to increase RCL’s full-year 2023 guidance.

Initially, we owned and traded around a small position in CIT Group Inc. (“CIT”) during the summer of 2020. We felt CIT was undervalued and management was making progress in reducing risk during the Covid-19 pandemic. In late 2020, CIT agreed to be acquired by First Citizens. We added to our CIT stake the morning of the acquisition announcement because we thought the acquisition was so financially attractive that First Citizens’ shares would rally and pull CIT’s shares higher. Our CIT shares were exchanged for First Citizens shares when the merger completed. We held onto our First Citizens shares because we admired the management team, we felt the bank was undervalued, and we projected the bank would benefit from higher interest rates. Then, earlier this year, First Citizens was the winning bidder in the FDIC’s auction of the failed Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). We added significantly to the Fund’s First Citizens position on the following Monday morning because the deal was unbelievably favorable for First Citizens.

AAPL,2024-01-07,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These 5 Stocks.

Jim Cramer recently said in a program that the time has come for investors to take some profits on the Magnificent Seven group of stocks as the market begins to undergo a rotation. Cramer said “it’s a new market” in 2024 and financial, healthcare and small-cap stocks which were put on the backburner by the Street amid recession fears are now in the spotlight. Cramer said that the market is favoring “boring” stocks with high yields as investors believe recession fears have been managed by the Federal Reserve and rates are expected to come down.

Cramer said long-term interest rates peaked in October 2023 and since then high-yield dividend stocks have been “flying"" while Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their leadership position when it comes to stock market gains. Cramer said that during most of 2023 Magnificent Seven stocks, which include major companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), among other tech leaders, led the stock market gains. But after October 2023, things have changed. Cramer shared a chart which showed S&P 500 performance trends on an equal-weighted basis. Data shows that an equal-weighted S&P 500 has beaten the Magnificent Seven index by 13.4% from October 2023 through January 3, 2024.

Jim Cramer said that “all sorts of stocks” are now showing strong performance and gains are no longer limited to the seven major tech stocks. Cramer mentioned some major banks and said financial stocks have been among the top performers in the current environment.

Jim Cramer also highlighted that there’s a broader money rotation going on in the market right now, with major tech stocks like Nvidia, Apple and Tesla acting as “sources of funds.” That means money managers are taking profits from these stocks and putting these funds into other companies that have hitherto been ignored amid the macro economic backdrop.

AAPL,2024-06-24,"After the latest AI announcements at the WWDC event, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.

Notable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.

Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:

“Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.”

RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:

“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.

Young Americans have always been allured by the idea of leaving their 9-to-5 grind and enjoying the prime of their lives by the beach and doing what they love. But in recent years, this idea has seen a dramatic rise in popularity. In a recent survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 45.8% of the respondents said they would likely be working after age 62. This metric averaged 55% between March 2014 and March 2020, according to the bank.

The early retirement movement gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as millions of Americans started working from home and saving money from stimulus checks. In October 2021, St. Louis Federal Reserve economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro estimated that a whopping three million Americans retired early due to the pandemic. However, this phenomenon, also known as ‘The Great Resignation,' reversed as inflation began to impact American households.

Early retirement communities such as Reddit’s /FinancialIndependence are still growing. Investing in dividend stocks is often pitched as one of the quicker and safest ways to retire early on Reddit. We scoured several discussion boards on Reddit to see the most popular dividend stocks recommended by investors on the platform for retirement based on their personal experience.

Pfizer

Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) is a notable dividend stock popular among Redditors looking to live off dividends. Pfizer shares are down about 7% over the past year. The stock yields around 6%, which is high compared to the sector average of about 2.3%. Redditors think Pfizer is going through a post-COVID slump, but it’s poised to rebound on the back of strong growth catalysts in the pipeline. During the first quarter, Pfizer’s revenue from non-COVID products saw an 11% operational growth year-over-year. Pfizer has increased its dividend for 14 straight years.

Philip Morris

With 16 consecutive years of dividend growth and a 5% yield, the tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) is a top choice for many Redditors who live entirely off dividends. Amid a decline in the popularity of traditional tobacco products, Philip Morris is aggressively expanding into tobacco-free products. The company plans to generate about two-thirds of its net revenues from nontraditional products by 2030. The company posted strong Q1 results in April and updated full-year 2024 guidance. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $1.50, surpassing estimates by $0.09, while revenue jumped 9.7% YoY to $8.8 billion, beating the consensus estimate by $350 million. Philip Morris expects its organic revenue growth in 2024 to total somewhere between 7% and 8.5%, up from its previous forecast of 6.5% to 8%.

Main Street Capital

Texas-based business development company Main Street Capital Corp (NYSE:MAIN) is one of the most popular monthly dividend stocks among Redditors in retirement and dividend communities on the social media platform. Main Street has been paying dividends consistently since 2007 and has upped its dividend every year since 2014.

Main Street’s management said during the Q1 earnings call that the company’s net investment income in the quarter was 54% higher than the monthly dividends the company paid to its shareholders and 9% more than the total dividends paid to shareholders. Total investment income in the March quarter came in at $131.6 million, easily beating the Street’s consensus of $127.9 million.

Altria

Reddit’s retirement and dividend communities love Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) because of its dividend yield (over 8%) and impressive dividend growth history (54 consecutive years of increases). Retail investors on Reddit believe the stock is undervalued and poised to grow due to recreational marijuana and tobacco-free product growth.

Last year, Altria completed its $2.75 billion acquisition of NJOY Holdings, an e-vapor products company. Analysts believe growth from the oral tobacco category and vaping products could offset declines from the smokable products segment.

Altria’s valuation is indeed depressed. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 9.05, much lower than the industry average P/E of 17.24.

IBM

International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IMB) is one of the most talked-about stocks in Reddit retirement and dividend communities since many Redditors living off dividends have the tech stock in their portfolios. IBM is that sweet spot between dividend income and stock growth, as some Redditors think the company’s cloud and AI business has the potential to boost IBM’s share.

IBM has 29 years of consecutive dividend growth and yields 3.95%. In April, IBM increased its quarterly dividend by 0.6% to $1.66 per share. During the same month, IBM said it would buy HashiCorp. for $6.4 billion. The company stated the acquisition would allow it to expand its hybrid cloud platform for AI. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said IBM has the ability to drive HashiCorp’s growth across its customer base.

Realty Income

California-based REIT Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) is one of the top monthly dividend stocks, having raised its dividends for 29 straight years. Redditors are fond of this high-yield (5.9%) dividend growth stock. Realty Income hiked its monthly dividend by 0.2% on June 11 to $0.263 per share. The company has also increased the lower end of its 2024 earnings guidance. It now expects adjusted FFO per share in the year to come in between $4.15 and $4.21, up from its prior guidance of $4.13 to $4.21.

Apple

Despite having a low yield, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the favorite dividend stocks on Reddit, as retail investors on the platform believe the iPhone maker is a solid addition to a diversified dividend portfolio. With excess cash and rising competition, Apple prioritizes shareholder returns more than ever. It has raised dividends every year over the past decade. Earlier this year, Apple hiked its dividend by 4%. It’s still a growth stock, with many analysts betting that Apple’s AI plans will bear fruit. The stock jumped to new highs after Apple’s latest AI-related announcements during the annual Worldwide Developers Conference.

In the latest note, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo praised Apple’s AI move and said the company could have a competitive edge over peers as it has ""successfully defined on-device AI.""

Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) has over six decades of dividend growth, a solid business, and a 3% yield. Redditors believe this old-school, ""boring"" dividend stock is important for any balanced dividend portfolio. Coca-Cola’s organic revenue during the first quarter jumped 11% year-over-year.

The company’s defensive business makes it an all-weather dividend stock. In May, Goldman Sachs said in a note that Coca-Cola is one of the stocks ""insulated"" from headwinds from wavering consumer spending amid rising inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Four more U.S. states on Tuesday joined the Justice Department's lawsuit against Apple Inc alleging the iPhone maker is monopolizing smartphone markets, the department said in a statement.

The four states are Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada and Washington, the Justice Department said. The original lawsuit was filed in March, and 15 states and the District of Columbia joined the lawsuit at the time.

The lawsuit alleges that Apple uses its market power to get more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants. The civil lawsuit accuses Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones, maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access from, developers.

The Justice Department has previously said Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and makes a larger profit than any rival. Officials also said Apple imposes hidden charges on various business partners - from software developers to credit card companies and even rivals such as Alphabet's, Google, in ways that ultimately raise prices for consumers.

Apple has said it plans to ask a federal judge in New Jersey to throw the case out, arguing that it ""faces fierce competition from well-established rivals.""

A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Intel, once a glamorous semiconductor manufacturer, has suffered several setbacks in recent years due to its rigid business model and underinvestment in high-growth areas. While competitors like NVIDIA, AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company have thrived, Intel has plummeted by 36% year to date, making it the worst-performing tech stock in the S&P 500.

Intel’s troubles began when it missed the mobile chip boom by failing to secure a deal with Apple Inc. The mobile chip market, now worth $23.7 billion, is dominated by TSM. Intel’s rigid business model has also contributed to the loss of its semiconductor market share to TSM and chips business to NVIDIA and AMD.

However, Intel is overhauling its business model and making significant efforts to catch up with the competition. CEO Patrick Gelsinger states that the company is accelerating its efforts to close the technology gap created by a decade of underinvestment, aiming to catch up by 2026.

Despite its challenges, Intel remains the undisputed champion in the CPU manufacturing industry, with half of its revenues coming from this segment. Canalys, a leading global technology market analyst firm, predicts that global PC shipments will explode in 2024 and 2025, driven by AI-enabled PCs. Analysts predict that Intel’s year-over-year revenues from this segment will grow by 11% in 2024 and 21% in 2025.

Intel is also expected to benefit from its Data Center and AI segment, which accounts for about 30% of its total revenues. The company’s recently released Gaudi 3 AI accelerator outperforms NVIDIA’s H100 GPU by 50% in AI tasks while being cheaper and more energy efficient.

As Intel works to reclaim its position as a market leader in the chip industry, the stock could be a good buy for long-term investing. Currently trading at the bottom of its 52-week low, Intel presents an opportunity to buy at a discount.

For income investors, Intel offers a dividend yield of 1.62% and has increased its dividend for eight consecutive years.

AAPL,2024-06-07,"Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces competition from Huawei Technologies Co’s latest AI chip, the Ascend 910B, which a Huawei executive claims matches or surpasses Nvidia’s A100 in some tests.

The Ascend 910B delivers 80% of the A100’s efficiency when training large language models and can outperform it by 20% in other tests.

These claims come amid strict US export restrictions that prevent Nvidia from shipping advanced GPUs to China, SCMP reports.

Huawei introduced the Ascend series in 2019 and has built a robust proprietary software and hardware ecosystem.

Despite the constraints, Huawei’s AI strategy has gained traction, with the Ascend chips adopted by major Chinese tech firms like Tencent Holding Ltd (OTC:TCEHY), Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), and iFlyTek. Huawei’s AI chips are integral to its goal of achieving technological self-sufficiency in China as it continues to expand its influence in the domestic market.

Analysts have noted Chinese manufacturers’ challenges in producing high-performance AI computing chips using older systems.

AI chips like Nvidia’s A100 are significantly more extensive and complex than typical smartphone chips.

However, Huawei’s Ascend 910B and Kunpeng chips have emerged as viable alternatives for domestic AI applications.

According to an analyst, while Huawei’s best chips are still technologically inferior to Nvidia’s latest GPUs, the company’s AI strategy and domestic market adaptations present substantial competition to Nvidia within China.

Reportedly, China’s leading chip manufacturer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, has been ramping up its chip production with domestic tools.

Prior reports indicated Tencent’s development of AI chips to gain a slice of Nvidia’s market share, which dominated up to 90% of China’s $7 billion AI chip market.

Meanwhile, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia remain committed to the Chinese market with their tailor-made AI chips.

Nvidia recently reached a market valuation of over $3 trillion, beating Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second most valuable company. This Wednesday, Nvidia added close to $150 billion in market cap.

Price Action: NVDA shares were trading lower by 1.15% at $1,196.05 at the last check on Friday.

AAPL,2024-06-06,"On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) shares hit a record high due to the global AI frenzy.

Additionally, TSMC is in talks with ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) to acquire advanced lithography machines, expected by year-end.

Meanwhile, Chinese AI chip firms are designing less powerful processors to comply with U.S. sanctions, underscoring the importance of TSMC.

Recent reports indicated TSMC’s plans to raise the prices of its services.

TSMC also announced a buyback of 3.25 million shares and plans for a $7.8 billion facility in Singapore with Vanguard International Semiconductor and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI).

TSMC’s surge followed Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gains, which reached a record high, breaching Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) market cap. TSMC is a key technology supplier for Nvidia’s AI chips.

Nvidia looks to boost its investments in Taiwan, including constructing another supercomputer in Taiwan following the launch of Taipei-1 in 2023.

Interestingly, Nvidia has also tapped Samsung Electronics Co for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip supply and is eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier as TSMC struggled with supply chain constraints.

TSMC, which won the crown of the leading global foundry with a 62% market share, indicated 10% annual growth in the semiconductor industry, excluding memory chips.

Analysts don’t see the fizzling of the AI demand anytime soon, hailing Nvidia as the key beneficiary. Nvidia’s moat extends beyond gaming, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data centers.

TSMC stock gained over 63% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the semiconductor sector via First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:FTXL) and ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:SSG).

Price Action: TSM shares were trading higher by 1.94% at $166.07 premarket at the last check on Thursday.

AAPL,2024-06-03,"NEW YORK (AP) — The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 13% last year, easily surpassing the gains for workers at a time when inflation was putting considerable pressure on Americans' budgets.

The median pay package for CEOs rose to $16.3 million, up 12.6%, according to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar. Meanwhile, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers rose 4.1% through 2023. At half the companies in AP's annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale almost 200 years to make what their CEO did.

“In this post-pandemic market, the desire is for boards to reward and retain CEOs when they feel like they have a good leader in place,” said Kelly Malafis, founding partner of Compensation Advisory Partners in New York.

The AP’s CEO compensation survey included pay data for 341 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.

Hock Tan, the CEO of Broadcom, topped the AP survey with a pay package valued at about $162 million.

Broadcom granted Tan stock awards valued at $160.5 million on Oct. 31, 2022, for the company's 2023 fiscal year. Tan was given the opportunity to earn up to 1 million shares starting in fiscal 2025, according to a securities filing, provided that Broadcom’s stock meets certain targets – and he remains CEO for five years.

At the time of the award, Broadcom’s stock was trading at $470. The stock has skyrocketed since, and reached an all-time high of $1,436.17 on May 15. Tan will receive the full award if the average closing price is at or above $1,125 for 20 consecutive days between October 2025 and October 2027.

Broadcom noted that under Tan its market value has increased from $3.8 billion in 2009 to $645 billion (as of May 23) and that its total shareholder return during that time easily surpassed that of the S&P 500.

Other CEOs at the top of AP’s survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million).

Lisa Su, CEO of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, was the highest paid female CEO in the AP survey for the fifth year in a row in fiscal 2023, bringing in compensation valued at $30.3 million — flat with her compensation package in 2022. Her overall rank rose to 21 from 25.

Workers across the country have been winning higher pay since the pandemic, with wages and benefits for private-sector employees rising 4.1% in 2023 after a 5.1% increase in 2022, according to the Labor Department.

Even with those gains, the gap between the person in the corner office and everyone else keeps getting wider. Half the CEOs in this year’s pay survey made at least 196 times what their median employee earned. That’s up from 185 times in last year’s survey.

The disparity between what the chief executive makes and the workers earn wasn't always so wide.

After World War II and up until the 1980s, CEOs of large publicly traded companies made about 40 to 50 times the average worker’s pay, said Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets for the AFL-CIO, which runs an Executive Paywatch website that tracks CEO pay.

“The (current) pay ratio signals a sort of a winner take all culture, that companies are treating their CEOs as, you know, as superstars as opposed to, team players,” Rees said.

Despite the criticism, shareholders tend to give overwhelming support to pay packages for company leaders. From 2019 to 2023, companies typically received just under 90% of the vote for their executive compensation plans, according to data from Equilar.

Shareholders do, however, occasionally reject a compensation plan, although the votes are non-binding. In 2023, shareholders at 13 companies in the S&P 500 gave the pay package less than 50% support.

Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said Say on Pay votes are important because they “shine a spotlight on some of the most egregious cases of executive access, and it can lead to negotiations over pay and other issues that shareholders might want to raise with corporate leadership.”

After its investors gave another resounding thumbs down to the pay packages for its top executives, Netflix met with many of its biggest shareholders last year to discuss their concerns.

Following the talks, Netflix announced several changes to redesign its pay policies. For one, it eliminated executives’ choice to allocate their compensation between cash and options. It will no longer give out stock options, which can give executives a payday as long as the stock price stays above a certain level. Instead, the company will give restricted stock that executives can profit from only after a certain amount of time or after certain performance measures are met.

The changes will take effect in 2024.

More broadly, say on pay votes haven't made a big difference, Anderson says. “I think the impact, certainly on the overall size of CEO packages has not had much effect in some cases.”

DHOLERA, India /NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans a raft of business-friendly measures if he wins a third term this week, including pushing through regulations making it easier to hire and fire workers, according to two government officials familiar with the matter.

As part of an election pledge to transform India into a global manufacturing hub, Modi wants to offer subsidies for domestic production modelled on recent packages for semiconductor firms and electric vehicle makers, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to media.

The premier also plans to reduce import taxes on key inputs for locally-made goods, which have pushed up India's manufacturing costs, the officials said.

Modi's office and the labour and finance ministries did not respond to Reuters' questions.

Exit polls project that the right-wing coalition led by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will win a big majority when election results are announced on June 4.

Modi's reelection campaign was partly built on the promise of continued economic development. He's pitching India as an alternative for global firms diversifying their supply chains from China.

India is the world's fastest-growing major economy. But that includes both a booming tech sector and a struggling older economy that doesn't provide enough jobs for everyone else, said Josh Felman, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's office in India.

""What can be done now to provide employment - good jobs for these people - is manufacturing,"" Felman said.

India successfully lured suppliers for major U.S. corporations like Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. But less than 3% of global manufacturing takes place in the world's most populous country, compared to 24% for China, World Bank data shows.

The government plans to increase India's share of global manufacturing to 5% by 2030 and 10% by 2047, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. It did not provide specifics.

Reuters spoke to 15 people - including bureaucrats, representatives of major investors, economists and trade unionists - who identified three significant obstacles holding India back from manufacturing hub status: restrictive labour laws, challenges acquiring land, and a rigidly inefficient tariff regime.

INDIA'S PEARL RIVER DELTA?

When Modi was chief minister of his home state of Gujarat between 2001 and 2014, he dreamt up an investment zone in the Dholera region. Legislation creating the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR) was passed in 2009 and local authorities began acquiring land for it in 2013.

The plan, Modi said during a 2011 visit to a Chinese port, was to develop DSIR along the ""Shanghai model"".

Starting in the 1980s, China set up special economic zones along its southeastern coast that are widely credited for it becoming the world's factory floor.

Land reform was a precursor for China's manufacturing rise. Starting in the 1970s, Beijing separated ownership from usage rights, making it easier for investors to acquire industrial land, said Henry Gao, a Chinese trade expert at Singapore Management University (SMU).

Beijing's industrial zoning policies also made it easier for industries to set up in areas with ready access to materials and facilities, he said.

As prime minister, Modi has continued to stress the importance of industrial zones for India. In March, he described facilities under construction in DSIR as central to the creation of an Indian semi-conductor manufacturing hub.

Tata Group announced plans in January to build India's first semi-conductor fabrication plant there. During a visit in March, Reuters also saw construction activity for an upcoming cargo airport and promotional billboards set up by real-estate developers.

There were paved roads and a waterfront but little sign of bustling business.

DSIR hopes to attract more manufacturing companies by providing leases of up to 99 years on government-owned land, said Rahul Gupta, head of the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation.

Local officials have said that it took more than a decade to acquire land and award infrastructure contracts, but Gupta predicted there would be much more activity in about two to three years.

Outside such zones, industrial groups still have to undergo a ""very difficult process"" to acquire the large plots of land they need because title deeds are often unclear and holdings are fractured, said Richard Rossow of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.

In May, Foxconn - whose local investment was trumpeted as a major success by Modi - was met with protests by farmers in Karnataka state unhappy with the compensation they received from local authorities for giving up their land to the manufacturer, Indian media reported.

The Taiwanese company didn't return a request for comment.

LABOUR STRUGGLES

In much of India, firms with more than 100 employees need authorisation from state governments to hire and fire.

This prevents companies from adjusting their operations to meet demand, said Atul Gupta, partner at Bengalore law firm Trilegal.

The BJP-controlled parliament has passed legislation to raise the threshold before official approval to 300, but state authorities that must consent to the changes have stalled the move.

Modi hopes that a strong win on June 4th will give him the momentum and political capital to push through their opposition, the two government officials said.

""No government wants to come across as giving permission to a company to let go of their employees (but)...this is just used to drag out the closure or the terminations endlessly,"" said Gupta, who advocates labour reforms.

General Motors, for instance, decided to shut plants in Gujarat and neighboring Maharastra in 2017, citing low sales. But unions opposed the closures and GM only received judicial approval to exit India completely in January. The U.S. carmaker declined to comment.

To avoid such difficulties, companies end up using contract workers for extended periods, said labour lawyer Amrish Patel.

HSBC economists said that sweeping changes to labour regulations as well as land reforms are needed to sustain high growth.

In a note to investors last month, HSBC economist Pranjul Bhandari wrote that such reforms could allow India to grow at 7.5-8% over the next decade, creating a wealth of jobs.

But lawyer and union leader Sanjay Singhvi said nearly 60% of the workers who benefit from current labour laws would lose protections if the BJP's codes are implemented.

Praveen Chakravarty, a senior economics policy official with the main opposition Congress, told Reuters that labour law decisions should be left to the states. His party's manifesto calls for a review of the labour codes passed by parliament.

TARIFF LAND

Manufacturing costs in India are also elevated because of tariffs on imports, including components for high-end manufacturing.

To encourage smartphone production, Delhi cut import duties on components to 10%. But competitor Vietnam already levies a rate of between 0% and 5% on equivalent inputs, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association.

The average import tariff imposed by India on World Trade Organisation (WTO) members was 18.1%, compared to 7.5% for China, according to WTO data for 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available.

Customs processes are also significantly quicker and less burdensome in China, said Gao.

Imports can clear customs in China in about 20 hours, said the SMU professor. It takes between 44 and 85 hours in India, according to a 2023 government study.

Beijing has focused its efforts on being a key node in the supply chain rather than attempting to own the entire chain, leading to greater efficiencies.

For instance, products exported by China often include inputs from other Northeast Asian countries, said Christian de Guzman of Moody’s Ratings.

But Delhi ""wants to have the entire thing come onshore,"" Guzman said.

AAPL,2024-06-02,"Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is concerned about some of OpenAI’s business dealings, particularly a potential agreement between OpenAI and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Satya Nadella recently met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to discuss this deal involving integrating OpenAI services into Apple products.

Nadella’s concerns stem from the potential impact on Microsoft’s product ambitions, the Business Insider reports.

Apple’s deal with OpenAI will solidify Altman’s control over the company after his brief ouster last fall.

Altman, who has pushed out rivals from the board, aims to replace Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as Apple’s search partner for Safari and build AI chip factories.

However, Microsoft, a significant investor in OpenAI, is concerned about the impact of the Apple deal on its own AI ambitions, according to the New York Post.

Apple considered both Google and OpenAI for this multi-billion-dollar deal.

If confirmed, this agreement would be a significant win for Altman, who has faced scrutiny from former employees and board members.

Tensions within OpenAI have reportedly been brewing since Altman’s brief ouster in November. An insider revealed to The Financial Times that Microsoft pressured OpenAI to prioritize commercial products, exacerbating existing tensions between executives.

Despite these challenges, OpenAI’s valuation has soared to $90 billion since launching ChatGPT.

Altman is considering converting OpenAI into a for-profit corporation to attract significant capital and expand its AI infrastructure.

OpenAI’s annual revenue crossed the $2 billion mark. The ChatGPT parent eyes doubling revenue by 2025.

Microsoft stock gained over 26% in the last 12 months. Apple gained 8%.

Price Actions: MSFT shares traded higher by 0.06% at $414.93 premarket at the last check Friday. AAPL is down 0.14% at $191.03.

AAPL,2024-05-25,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is indeed Warren Buffett's favorite Dow stock as his firm, Berkshire Hathaway owns 789,368 million of the company shares worth $135.361 billion as of the first quarter of 2024. However, we recently identified the best Dow stocks according to hedge funds, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) takes the 5th spot on our list of Best Dow Stocks. To view the number 1 Dow stock to buy now, go to 8 Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

On May 17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed out at record highs, crossing the 40,000 milestone for the first time ever. However, this was a little shortlived as the index is down nearly 2.35% since that day, as of May 23. While the index seems to be underperforming the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, it doesn’t fully cover the market conditions like the latter two. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ’s performance is mostly dominated by mega-cap tech stocks, especially NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which isn’t a part of the Dow Jones index.

Dow Bucks Trend, Falls Despite NVIDIA's Upbeat News

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported its first-quarter 2025 earnings on May 22. Despite record numbers, the market failed to rally along with the company. This includes the Dow Jones index as all 30 of its components ended the day in red on May 23, including some of the best Dow stocks that are direct AI beneficiaries such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

In its Q1 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) generated a revenue of $26.04 billion, which was up over 262% year-over-year and surprised the consensus estimates by $1.45 billion. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12, an over 460% increase year-over-year. Moreover, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10 for 1 split, which will take effect on June 7. For the second quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects a revenue of $28.0 billion. The company predicts that the automotive sector will emerge as the leading enterprise vertical within its Data Center division in the current year. At its Q1 2025 earnings call, the company’s CFO, Colette Kress said:

“Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla’s expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption.”

After reporting stellar earnings, NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price crossed the $1000 mark for the first time and was 9.3% higher in a day, at the May 3 market close. Nevertheless, the company failed to rally the market with it as the S&P 500 was down almost 0.75% during the same period, the NASDAQ-composite recorded a decline of 0.4% and the Dow Jones index experienced its worst day in almost 14 months declining by over 1.5%.

Jim Cramer: Celebrating the 40K Milestone

Even though the Dow Jones index is underperforming other indices in 2024, CNBC Mad Money host, Jim Cramer still believes in celebrating its 40,000 points milestone. On May 20, he urged the investors to appreciate the market's progress despite past downturns. Cramer emphasized that while the Dow does not fully represent the market like the S&P 500, it reflects a team effort across various sectors, which should have been demolished by the challenges they faced, such as the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, inflation, and supply chain issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet they thrived. He acknowledged the potential for market declines but stressed the importance of recognizing the achievements of these stocks and companies over the years.

Cramer mentioned that he started as a summer associate in 1983 at Goldman Sachs when the Dow was just over 1000 points, the market was full of bears in multiple sectors but the stock market “left them behind.” He added that the index going from 1000 to 40,000 shows the strength of these companies and that they “will make you money.”

In light of these comments, some of the best Dow stocks include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). You can also take a look at the 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.

By Carolina Mandl

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Coatue Management dissolved its stake in Apple Inc in the first quarter while Viking Global Investors built a sizeable new position, securities filings showed on Wednesday. Coatue, founded by Philippe Laffont, had 2.4 million shares of Apple in December, worth $470.6 million. Regulatory filings showed it had dissolved that stake entirely by the end of March.

Apple's shares plunged almost 11% in the first quarter as the company faced fiercer competition in China and falling revenues. Shares in the iPhone maker have pared losses in the second quarter and are now down 1.5% year to date. Other big investors have cut their stakes in Apple. Earlier this month, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had trimmed its position by 13%. Still, Buffett praised the company during Berkshire's annual meeting, saying the iPhone was ""one of the greatest products."" Coatue's filing also showed it reduced its stake in chipmaking giant Nvidia by roughly 68% to 1.4 million shares, or $1.2 billion. Year to date, shares in Nvidia are up 91%.

Coatue also trimmed its position in electric vehicle maker Tesla by 37% to 2.6 million shares. The company's shares are down almost 30% this year amid fierce competition and slowing sales. Coatue, however, more than doubled its holdings in Google-parent Alphabet, to 5.7 million shares. Conversely, Viking showed in the filing a new $663.8 million stake in Apple and a similar position in Microsoft.

The funds' positions were revealed in quarterly securities fillings known as 13Fs. While backward looking, these snapshots show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one of the few ways hedge funds and other institutional investors have to declare their positions. The filings do not indicate exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current holdings.

Both Coatue and Viking are so-called Tiger cubs, hedge funds seeded by veteran investor Julian Robertson, founder of Tiger Management.

AAPL,2024-05-07,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett shared his views on success, business advice and life decisions during an interview with Yahoo Finance.

“I’ve said many times that if you get to be 65 or 70 and later, and the people that you want to have love you actually do love you, you’re a success,” he said.

Happiness often correlates more strongly with relationships than with wealth, Buffett said.

Don't Miss:

This Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here’s how anyone can invest for a limited time.

Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women’s health problem at 80 cents per share.

Buffett highlighted the importance of surrounding yourself with exemplary people, saying, “You want to associate with people that are better than you are. I mean, basically, you’ll go in the direction of the people that you associate with.”

Buffett, a man who held the title of world’s richest man for much of the late 1990s and early 2000s, lives a humble and modest life despite his wealth. He bought his house in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1958 for $31,500 and has lived in it ever since. Despite being worth tens of billions of dollars and growing Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to an $800 billion giant, he still regularly eats fast food and drives older, used cars.

Trending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.

Buffett’s approach extends to his diet and routine. He prefers simple, enjoyable foods he liked as a child over health trends, commenting on his dietary choices with a hypothetical scenario where he refuses one more year of life if his diet consists of disliked vegetables.

Buffett advocates for substantial self-investment, particularly in communication skills, which he believes can boost an individual's worth by 50%. He humorously noted, “It’s like winking at a girl in the dark — nothing happens,” to stress the importance of effective communication. If you can't get your ideas across, no matter how good the ideas are, then you're not going to be successful.

In the interview, Buffett emphasized his long-standing investing ideas and strategies. Dubbed the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett is considered one of the greatest investors in modern history, and his strategies have been proven over decades. Buffett emphasized long-term investment strategies over frequent trading, comparing prudent investing to taking care of a car that must last a lifetime.

“All you have to do is just buy across a cross-section of America and hold,” he said.

Buffett has the same strategy for most of his acquisitions and investments. Find profitable, cash-producing companies that have done well over the long term, then invest in them as they continue to do well over the next decade. This has led to massive investments in Apple Inc., American Express and a host of other recognizable names.

AAPL,2024-05-04,"In this article, we discuss the 23 most profitable stocks of the last 12 months. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months.

The United States stock market has come a long way since the turn of the millennium more than two decades ago. Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times.

Investors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.

The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.

The fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.

“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.”

Our Methodology

To select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income. The Finance Charts database was then used to identify firms with the best net income growth in the past twenty years. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Madison Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“In the semiconductor industry, demand is closely tied to the economic cycle, and industry order patterns are magnified by its complex supply chain. Furthermore, it’s a capital and technology intensive industry, resulting in frequent overcapacity and product obsolescence. For these reasons, we shied away from any investment in the industry for many years. However, several years ago, we felt that segments of the industry had developed strong enough moats to merit investment under the right conditions. We made one investment (Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) in Large Cap) that we thought was compelling, but it wasn’t until late 2021 when the semiconductor industry entered a severe downturn, that we began purchasing semiconductor stocks in earnest. Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted. Thus, semiconductor stocks in general remain depressed, and our investments have so far shown mixed results.

In its Q4 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”

Here is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

AAPL,2024-05-03,"Technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported second-quarter financial results that saw revenue and earnings per share beat Street estimates.

Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan has a Buy rating and raises the price target from $225 to $230.

Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng has a Buy rating and $226 price target.

Keybanc analyst Brandon Nispel has a Sector Weight rating and no price target.

Bank of America on Apple: A multi-year upgrade cycle for Apple makes the stock a top pick for Mohan.

""Apple reported a strong quarter with many positives,"" Mohan said.

The analyst said third-quarter revenue guidance could be conservative with upside from Apple's Services and Accessories segments.

Mohan sees an iPhone upgrade cycle coming, driven by GenAI. The analyst also said Apple is growing iPhones in China and easing fears from investors.

The analyst highlights the AI opportunity for Apple.

""We expect Gen AI related features for iOS18 at WWDC in June and then at the iPhone event in Sep. We expect Apple to continue investment in its own Silicon and focus on integrating hardware, software and services to fully monetize the Gen AI opportunity.""

Goldman Sachs on Apple: Strength of Apple's Services and iPhone were keys in the second quarter for Ng.

""We gain confidence in our Buy rating with AAPL demonstrating the strength of its ecosystem and allaying several key concerns.""

The analyst said Apple showed improving trends in Greater China, including iPhone growth.

""In our view, F2Q24 provides demonstrable momentum across AAPL's key categories and clears the way to a catalyst-rich NTM including increased clarity in AAPL's generative AI initiatives, new products and ongoing Services momentum.""

Ng said Apple's installed base is ""underappreciated"" and the company's revenue per user could be improved in the future.

KeyBanc on Apple: Artificial intelligence is a key item for Apple going forward, according to Nispel. The analyst is not convinced that consumers will rush out to buy new Apple AI devices like investors believe.

""While F3Q guidance was better than feared, we believe it's more driven by new product introductions in Mac/iPad, as we believe is implied by the guidance iPhone is down MSD,"" Nispel said.

The analyst expects soft upgrades for replacement cycles in the U.S. and increased competition in China to weigh on the iPhone going forward.

""AAPL's user base is growing across products and geographies; its user growth fuels growth in Services, creating an ecosystem that gives AAPL a competitive advantage, which should support AAPL's margin expansion and capital allocation.""

Needham on Apple: Guidance, margins, share buybacks and China were keys in Apple's second quarter results for Martin.

""On China, AAPL stated that iPhone unit sales rose in mainland China vs channels checks of down 13% to 18%,"" Martin said.

One area of concern for Martin is Apple's commentary on generative AI.

""AAPL's GenAI commentary continues to be very weak (our view). Investors we talk to believe that GenAI is the next technology disruption, and AAPL continues to focus its commentary on the last disruption, which was mobile.""

Martin said Apple could be quiet about its GenAI ambitions, but capex spending guidance suggests it isn't increasing spending on the growth area.

The analyst said Apple was the biggest beneficiary of the consumer shift to mobile devices and could be slow in the ""3rd technological disruption cycle.""

DA Davidson on Apple: The second quarter was solid for Apple with a beat on revenue and earnings per share, Luria said.

The analyst is looking for more from Apple coming soon, turning attention to WWDC in June and more commentary on Apple's Generative AI efforts.

""We expect Apple to delivery meaningful announcements surrounding the implementation of generative AI across their ecosystem, which we believe can help catalyze a major upgrade cycle within product categories such as the iPhone,"" Luria said.

Luria also highlighted Apple's Services segment in the new investor note.

""We continue to believe that this growing segment of revenue can help moderate growth for Apple moving forward, with a large user install base that includes over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on their platform.""

Rosenblatt on Apple: Better-than-feared guidance from Apple was a highlight in the earnings report for Crockett.

The analyst said Apple's iPhone sales in China for the second quarter completely brushed off third party research estimates.

""In addition to growth in iPhone in China, Apple is bragging of setting sales record in major emerging markets globally, including India,"" Crockett said.

Crockett said Apple stock is best when it trades based on disruptive innovation.

""The only real investable opportunity is gen AI, where Apple plans announcements for its WWDC in June and can leverage its skill with the hardware/software integration and proprietary neural chips and privacy.""

Crockett said Apple's risk is that its Gen AI efforts are not appealing enough.

Piper Sandler on Apple: Headset concerns were the major item from Apple's second quarter, analyst Kumar is centering in on.

""The primary point of contention for Apple investors appears to be slowing handset growth in China, to which we point out that within China specifically the iPhone segment was down ~8%,"" Kumar said.

The analyst said Apple's quarter strength and reason for the stock being up is likely the Services segment, $110 billion buyback and better than expected results in China.

""Fundamentally we would like to see further improvements in iPhone trends before getting involved.""

AAPL Price Action: Apple shares are up 7% to $185.22 on Friday, versus a 52-week trading range of $164.08 to $199.62.

AAPL,2024-05-01,"Markets wobbled at the start of Wednesday's trading session as investors geared up for the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.

According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, it's a foregone conclusion that the Fed will hold rates steady today. And while markets have already priced in the Fed's decision, investors will listen closely to Fed Chair Jay Powell's afternoon speech and answers to reporter questions for further clues about the future direction of interest rates.

SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, slid by a quarter of a percentage point while DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust inched 0.2% higher.

The Fed meeting has grabbed attention from tech earnings. Amazon.com Inc. reported first-quarter beats on both top and bottom lines after Tuesday's closing bell, with the tech giant saying profit more than tripled year-over-year to $10.4 billion. It's shares jumped about 2.5%.

Amazon is the largest holding in XLY, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund, which dropped 0.6% in midmorning trading.

QQQ, the Invesco QQQ Trust which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, slid by half a percent as investors awaited the Fed decision. Tech has gained this year, despite the ""higher for longer"" rate environment. But QQQ has underperformed the broader market, as higher interest rates keep high growth companies like those in the tech sector under pressure.

But while tech might not be keeping pace with the wider market, the Mag 7 is blowing it out of the water. MAGS, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which holds the Magnificent Seven in its fund, jumped 0.4%, boosted by Amazon. MAGS has soared just under 18% so far this year.

MAGS vs. SPY Performance

More tech earnings will be on deck this week as Apple Inc. is set to report tomorrow after the bell. And on Friday, investors will turn their attention to the state of the labor market for the April jobs report.

Any strength (or weakness) in the jobs market will also provide investors with further clues on future path of rates. The Fed uses the jobs data as a proxy for the strength of the U.S. economy since a stronger economy is better equipped to handle higher rates.",0.2554999999999999,0.5428333333333334,Positive,0.508023202419281,0.4877118709711333
AAPL,2024-04-30,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has aggressively recruited dozens of artificial intelligence experts from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, establishing a secretive AI laboratory in Zurich, Europe.

This move comes as the company intensifies its efforts to lead in new AI model and product development.

Apple, valued at $2.7 trillion, has been expanding its global AI and Machine Learning team by poaching many specialists from Google since hiring John Giannandrea as its top AI executive in 2018.

This includes at least 36 experts who have since joined Apple, the Financial Times reports.

In addition to its central AI teams in California and Seattle, Apple has grown its presence in Zurich, Switzerland. This expansion followed the acquisitions of two local AI startups, leading to the creation of the “Vision Lab” in Zurich.

The Zurich team has contributed to research on advanced AI models that merge text and visual inputs, which are crucial for products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple has advertised several generative AI positions in Zurich, maintaining a low profile in the area.

The company plans to showcase new generative AI features at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, potentially transforming the next iPhone into a more sophisticated voice-activated assistant with an enhanced Siri capable of interacting with all apps via voice control.

Apple analysts projected a slight increase in revenue for the March quarter and a significant guide-down for the June quarter compared to consensus, followed by a negative market reaction.

The critical event following the earnings will be Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where analysts anticipate new AI software features will be a significant highlight, with Apple experiencing a relief rally.

Analysts will be closely watching the March quarter for total revenue, focusing on revenue from China (where he expects iPhone shipments to be down 28% year-over-year) and growth in Services revenue, which he projects at 12.7% year-over-year.

Apple stock gained over 2% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK).

Price Action: AAPL shares trade higher by 0.22% at $173.88 at the last check Tuesday.

AAPL,2024-04-28,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at American Politicians are Selling These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article American Politicians are Selling These 5 Stocks.

Congressman Michael McCaul from Texas's 10th congressional district is the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. McCaul was one of the leading politicians calling for a ban on TikTok. He authored the bill against the Chinese social media company which the US Senate recently passed, calling TikTok a ""spy balloon in Americans' phones."" President Joe Biden has signed the bill into law that would ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance fails to divest the app within a year.

Congressman McCaul's Purchase of Meta Platforms Gains Attention

But when Congressman McCaul was working against TikTok, he was also busy amassing Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, according to his public disclosures. On March 5, the Congressman bought Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares worth between $100,000 to $250,000 at $490.22 per share. On March 1, he had bought somewhere between 200-498 Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, at $502.3 per share. Analysts believe a ban on TikTok would be a tailwind for US social media companies like Meta Platforms and Snapchat. Because of such overlaps, calls for a total ban on stock trading for politicians have been growing louder. But we aren’t interested in any such bans, since as retail investors any publicly available data showing what insiders are buying is an opportunity. Why? Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.

Stock trades from politicians in the US have always sparked controversies and made headlines over the past few years. In 2022, a Wall Street Journal investigation showed that thousands of officials working across 50 federal agencies were involved in buying or selling of stocks of companies that were directly affected by the decisions of their agencies. The Journal analyzed about 31,000 disclosures of 12,000 officials made during 2016 through 2021.

Do Politicians Beat the Market?

However, the most important question in any discussion surrounding American politicians trading stocks is this: do politicians' stock picks really beat the market? A detailed research by Unusual Whales found that in 2022, out of the 100 Congress members who traded stocks, 33% beat SPY with their portfolios. Another interesting insight highlighted in the report said that Democrats beat Republicans by significant margins. However, there were some anomalies. For example, former House Speaker Nany Pelosi's portfolio, which is often a topic of discussion and is keenly watched by investors, fell about 19.8% in 2022, more than the 18% decline for the SPY.

Politicians' stock picking skills received massive attention during the pandemic days. For example, Senator Rand Paul's wife bought shares in Gilead Sciences just before the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. So what? Analysts were quick to highlight that Paul was part of a Senate health committee that received special briefings from the then government about the pandemic situation in January 2020.

There have been several research reports highlighting instances where politicians used their influence to allegedly profit from different deals. For example a research paper titled “Trading” Political Favors: Evidence from the Impact of the STOCK Act"" talked about an interesting case from 2009:

""Politicians can favor certain groups of firms or individual firms in decisions that have significant economic impact on firm performance, such as the passage of legislations and regulations, the awarding of government contracts, and the selection into government programs. An example can be found in Congressman Tom Petri’s dealings with the Oshkosh Corporation, a manufacturer of specialty trucks and military vehicles. 2 In 2009, Representative Petri helped Oshkosh secure a $3 billion contract from the U.S. Army, after the award was challenged by a competitor and then under review by the Government Accountability Office, by sending letters and memos to colleagues and officials on the Hill and at the Pentagon including the Defense Secretary, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and the Secretary of the Army. Meanwhile, Petri owned a substantial amount of Oshkosh stock, valued at between $250,000 and $500,000, and purchased additional shares as he was making contacts on behalf of the company to resolve the dispute. Oshkosh’s stock price rose from $8 per share in early 2009 to $38 per share in February 2010, when its contract with the Army was finalized.""

Methodology For this article we scanned publicly available data and filings of American politicians and picked 10 stocks Congress members and senators were selling over the past few months. Some top names in the list include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

10. BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15

Congressman Scott Franklin from the Republican Party on March 21 sold a stake worth between $1 million to $5 million in insurance company BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP). Since then through April 24 BRP Group Inc's (NASDAQ:BRP) shares have lost about 8% in value.

In addition to BRP, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are also seeing insider selling.

9. Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 25

Greg Steube, the Republican Congressman from Florida's 17th congressional district, on March 28 sold shares in Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV) worth between $15,000 to $50,000 at $40.06 per share. Since then the stock is down 8%.

8. Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 50

Senator Tina Smith dumped insulin delivery systems company Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) shares on April 4 at $163.25. The total worth of these shares was between $50,000 to $100,000. Since then the stock is up 2.45%. Senator Markwayne Mullin also sold a stake in Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) back in December 2023.

Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), the diabetes management device company, was the second largest detractor to portfolio performance. The company was hit by negative sentiment regarding GLP-1 agonists and their potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on insulin therapy. Type 1 diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, which could offset the lower outlook for cases of type 2 diabetes, but the market ignored this development.”

7. NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 65

NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) ranks seventh in our list of the stocks sold by American politicians in 2024. Senator Tina Smith sold a stake worth between $100,000 to $250,000 in NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) on April 4. Since then the stock has gained about 4.43%. Congressman Rick Allen also sold NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) shares worth between $15,000 to $50,000 back in December 2023.

ClearBridge Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We added a new position in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), in the utilities sector, which acquires, owns and manages contracted clean energy projects in the U.S. The company was at the center of the defensive stock storm when it slowed its renewable growth outlook modestly in late September, and the stock collapsed almost 30% in less than two weeks. We saw this as an opportunity to invest in arguably the best combination of a regulated utility and an experienced renewable operator with good long-term growth options. Even at a much-reduced estimated growth rate from higher financing costs, which will likely prove to be conservative, our estimate of intrinsic business value is materially higher.”

Like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NEE is also seeing selling from Washington insiders.

6. Boeing Co (NYSE:BA)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 69

Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) continues to suffer amid safety concerns around its planes. The stock is down 34% this year through April 25. Congressman Bill Keating from the Democratic Party on February 8 dumped a stake worth between $15,000 to $50,000 in Boein. He had also sold Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares worth between $1K to $15K on February 28 at $207 per share. Since February 8 through April 24 Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares are down 21%.

AAPL,2024-04-24,"Tesla, on the other hand, has soared because it became the first company in the world to make and ship electric vehicles on scale. Its share price percentage gain over the past five years is double of AMD's and currently sits at 823%. But is Tesla still a growth stock? Here's what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC had to say about the firm as part of its Q4 2023 investor letter for the Large Cap Growth Strategy fund:

Tesla contributed to portfolio performance in the fourth quarter due to our underweight position relative to the growth index. Tesla reported disappointing third quarter earnings in mid-October in part, due to downtime at some factories that were being upgraded. The CEO expressed concern that higher interest rates were impacting demand for automobiles and would not comment on growth expectations for 2024. However, the expected scale production of the Cybertruck is 12 to 18 months in the future which we believe will negatively impact short-term growth.

So, which growth stocks might be great picks for 2024? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and read below for more:

AAPL,2024-04-23,"After a year with of layoffs and activist attention that triggered many changes, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE: SPOT) managed to surpass both top and bottom estimates. Moreover, the streaming giant reported record first quarter earnings as the result of efficient cost-cutting initiatives that also brought significant margin improvements.

First Quarter Financials Shows That A Shift In Focus Paid Off

For the quarter ended in March, Spotify reported revenue rise 20% YoY to 3.64 billion euros, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of 3.61 billion.

As a result of cost-cutting efforts that included layoffs, Spotify reported earnings of 97 euro cents which equate to $1.04, leaving LSEG’s estimate of 65 euro cents far behind as gross margin reached 27.6%.

Spotify ended its fiscal first quarter with 615 million monthly active users, which was 3 million short of StreetAccount’s estimate, but business grew as MAUs rose 19% YoY and 2% from the previous quarter. As part of cost-cutting measures, Spotify also lowered its marketing activity which also contributed to a more normalized growth. Spotify also grew its subscribers 14% YoY to 239 million.

Second Quarter Guidance

For the current quarter, Spotify guided for net new MAUs of 16 million, which would bring the total of monthly active users to 631 million. With cost improvements across its business, the Swedish streaming company also forecasted its gross margin will improve to 28.1%.

First Quarter Was A Victory For Spotify Across Many Fronts

Shifting its focus on strengthening revenue growth and expanding the margin paid off. In addition, the EU sided with Spotify in its epic battle with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the quarter. The EU punished Apple with a historic fine for distorting music streaming competition. Due to a complaint from Spotify, the EU already slapped Apple with an antitrust fine of $1.95 billion in March. This is a big victory for Spotify who started complaining back in 2019 about Apple preventing music streaming services from informing users of payment options outside its App Store. Despite the fact Apple is a tech titan, when it comes to music streaming, Spotify is the dominant one. Fortunately for Spotify, EU regulators are ignoring its dominance and going after Apple instead. Therefore, Spotify had a record profit as well as an epic win during the first quarter that will undoubtedly go down in its history.

UBS Cautions In Tech Sector

UBS Group AG's chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub has advised caution on tech stocks.

As reported by Bloomberg, UBS downgraded its stance on the ‘Big 6’ technology giants—Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia Corp.— from Overweight to Neutral amid slowing earnings momentum.

Golub suggests that the downturn in tech earnings momentum will be driven by wider cyclical challenges, not by worries about valuations or the industry's prospects in artificial intelligence.

AAPL,2024-04-22,"Last Thursday, the world’s largest producer of advanced processors issued its first quarter results and they were even better than expected as AI demand continues to go strong. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM), whose customers include the AI chip leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) as well as the tech titan Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), expects 2024 to be another year of healthy growth on the back of its technology leadership and broad customer base that also includes Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM).

First Quarter Highlights

For the quarter ended on March 31st, TSMC reported net revenue grew 16.5% YoY to NT$592.64 billion. Net income rose 8.9% YoY to NT$225.49 billion.

The net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, while an industry average is about 14%, reflecting TSMC’s competitiveness.

Nvidia Set To Become The TSMC Of AI

Earlier in March, Nvidia clearly stated its aim to become the TSMC for AI as it continues its expansion beyond hardware, entering into software services. During its annual conference, GTC 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangunveiled new tools. In terms of AI development, Nvidia aims to do for the world exactly that what TSMC does for the AI chip leader by turning its design and concept into physical chips. Therefore, TSMC builds the chips Nvidia, Apple and others need and Nvidia wants to become the AI maker, turning concepts of its clients into a model they get to bring with them.

Second Quarter Guidance

For the current quarter, TSMC is supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, but this strength is partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality. TSMC guided for second-quarter revenue in the range between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. Due to the recent earthquake in Taiwan along with higher electricity costs, TSMC expects the second quarter gross margin to decline by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint. Fortunately, the earthquake that occurred on April 3rd did not cause any power shortages, nor structural damage to the company’s facilities and critical tools such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system. One of its closest competitors, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), lost the lead because TSMC was the first to adopt EUV lithography systems that are essential for its leadership. Although some wafers were affected and had to be scrapped, most of the lost production should be recovered in current quarter, with minimal impact to revenue.

Outlook

With AI demand going strong, TSMC managed to weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand, fueling its stock to new heights. In 2025, TSMC is planning to begin mass-producing its 2-nanometer chips, which come with more power and efficiency compared to its current 3-nanometer ones. As for the full year, TSMC estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to more than double. For the full year, TSMC guided for low to mid-20% revenue growth under the assumption that the AI market continues to expand while the PC market stabilizes, and the smartphone market returns to growth amid an improved macroeconomic backdrop. Although TMSC might not keep the pace with Nvidia in terms of near-term gains due to the fact its business goes beyond chips, it certainly won’t be in a recovery mode like its client, Qualcomm, after the 2023 lulled the smartphone market to sleep. Qualcomm is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter results on May 1st. Best known for making smartphone chips, Qualcomm did surpass estimates with its fiscal first quarter financials and its upcoming report should reflect the business picking up as smartphone sales continue to recover.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Apple Inc plans to invest more than $250 million to expand its regional campus or operations in Ang Mo Kio, Singapore, according to a company statement dated April 17.

Two buildings acquired in 2022, located across from Apple's existing offices, will undergo a major upgrade, the U.S. technology giant said.

""Singapore is truly a one-of-a-kind place, and we are proud of the connection we've built with this dynamic community of creators, learners, and dreamers,"" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, said in a statement.

Apple opened its first facility in Singapore in 1981 with 72 employees focused on Apple II, its early personal computer.

It has since grown to house more than 3,600 employees in the city-state, which serves as an operations centre for Apple in the region.

Cook will meet Singapore's prime minister-designate Lawrence Wong as well as the city-state's incumbent leader Lee Hsien Loong this week as part of his Southeast Asia tour, Bloomberg News reported earlier on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook will meet Singapore’s leader at the tail end of his most extensive Southeast Asia tour in years, searching for new growth markets and manufacturing locations to offset headwinds in China.

Cook will be in Singapore on Thursday and Friday to meet with Lawrence Wong, who is set to take over as Prime Minister next month, as well as his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the executive’s itinerary isn’t public.

Apple’s CEO is on the verge of concluding a highly public tour that’s taken him from Hanoi to Jakarta, during which he repeatedly stressed the region’s importance as both a market and emergent manufacturing base. His company is looking for growth markets beyond China, a traditional stronghold where demand for its flagship iPhone is sputtering. The company is also diversifying its production beyond the communist country to reduce risks at a time of elevated tensions between the world’s two biggest superpowers.

From meetings with country leaders in Vietnam and Indonesia to interactions with local customers, Cook has filled a lion’s share of his schedule with publicity activities to generate interest in the brand, the people said. Apple has already increased its retail presence and output in countries such as India, and is now seeking to better tap a relatively fast-growing Southeast Asian market with more than 650 million consumers.

The trip could pave the way for a more aggressive sales campaign in a densely populated region where Android phones from Samsung Electronics Co., Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo dominate the market, said one of the people.

As part of the push, the company is getting close to opening the first Apple Store in Malaysia, located in an extravagant shopping complex in Kuala Lumpur. Apple currently operates five brick-and-mortar stores in Southeast Asia, three in Singapore and two in Thailand, according to its website.

The Singapore plans are subject to change, and Apple hasn’t made Cook’s schedule in the region public. Representatives for Apple, Singapore’s Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister’s Office didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Apple, which has operated in Singapore for over 40 years, said Wednesday it plans to invest $250 million to expand its campus in the city-state. The company employs more than 3,600 people there and said the expansion will provide space for new roles in artificial intelligence and other functions.

“Singapore is truly a one-of-a-kind place, and we are proud of the connection we’ve built with this dynamic community of creators, learners, and dreamers,” Cook said in a statement on Apple’s website. “With our growing campus, Apple is writing a new chapter in our history here.”

In the first leg of the tour, Cook met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on Tuesday after pledging new investment in the country. He said Apple plans to buy more components and accessories for its devices from Vietnam’s suppliers, a big boost for the country as it emerges as a global electronics hub.

In Indonesia, Cook told President Joko Widodo Apple is weighing the possibility of making some of its gadgets there. The two also discussed Indonesia’s controversial new trade rule to get more goods produced onshore, one of the people said.

Southeast Asia has become an increasingly important market for Apple because of weak demand in China. The Cupertino, California-based company has struggled to sustain sales in the country since the debut of its latest iPhone 15 series, resulting in a 10% decline in first-quarter shipments. Beijing’s bans on the use of iPhones in government agencies and state-owned companies cast further uncertainty on Apple’s prospects in China.

While India is expected to become a major long-term driver, the iPhone accounts for less than 10% of the smartphones sold there now in part because of its lofty price tag.

HANOI (Reuters) -Apple Inc wants to boost its investment in Vietnam, state media quoted the U.S. tech giant's CEO Tim Cook as saying in Hanoi on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. company said it wanted to increase spending on suppliers in the Southeast Asian nation.

Vietnam is already a key manufacturing hub for Apple and Cook was speaking while meeting Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, state media reported.

Vietnam will set up a working group to support Apple's investment, Chinh told Cook during the meeting, according to state media.

""Today, Apple announced it will increase spending on suppliers in Vietnam, along with new progress in an initiative to support clean water for local schools,"" the company said in a statement released on Monday on its website.

Its spending has already reached some 400 trillion dong ($15.84 billion) and has created some 200,000 jobs, the statement added.

Apple did not respond to a request for additional comments about its spending.

Cook arrived in Hanoi on Monday for the two-day visit during which he met suppliers, students, content creators and users of Apple products.

Apple manufactures iPads, AirPods and Apple Watches in Vietnam and suppliers for MacBooks are also investing in the Southeast Asian country.

The company had 25 suppliers in Vietnam as of 2022, according to its latest suppliers list, the same as in the previous year and up from 21 in 2020. These suppliers include Foxconn, GoerTek, Luxshare, Intel, Samsung Electronics and Compal.

Suppliers to its main vendors, such as Foxconn, are also moving or planning to move to Vietnam, and some are shifting some activities out of China, amid U.S.-China tensions, according to several industry sources who declined to name the companies as the moves were still confidential.

While meeting Cook, Chinh said that Vietnam was seeking support from Apple to develop renewable energy as well as in high-quality human resource training, VTV said in a report.

Apple's latest announcement came days after activists urged the company to take action on Vietnam's detention of climate experts.

Wall Street analysts and wise investors often keep a close eye on insider buying and selling, since academic research has time and again proved that insiders often act as opportunists and make use of insider information while conducting insider transactions. This is especially true for insider purchases, as we have discussed the relevant academic research recently. But what about insider selling? While many believe insider selling is not predictive of anything substantial, there are a few angles in insider selling activity which should not be ignored as they might provide something of value for long-term investors.

When Should You Pay Attention to Insider Selling?

Ben Silverman, director of research at Verity, in his podcast entitled Things All Investors Should Know About Insider Selling, said that there are certain kinds of insider selling activities which are worthy of investors’ attention. Silverman specifically advised investors not to overlook insider selling transactions conducted under the Rule 10b5-1, which allows insiders to sell their company shares by delineating a specific plan, which mentions stock price, amount and transaction date in advance. The analyst said that there has been a misconception in the industry that insider selling under the Rule 10b5-1 is of “vanilla nature” and does not show “opportunistic” tendencies of insiders. Silverman believes some insiders have been using this rule to “sell opportunistically” and some of them have been “very smart about it.”

Important Insider Selling of 2024: Mark Zuckerberg Selling Meta Platforms

One of the examples of such transactions, according to Silverman, is Mark Zuckerberg’s selling Meta Platforms shares under the rule. Zuckerberg started selling Meta Platforms shares last year. He kept selling the stock almost daily, following a pattern. But Silverman said the size of Zuckerberg’s selling increased significantly in February 2024 when the social media company’s shares jumped. Silverman said Meta Platforms co-founder had adopted the Rule 10b5-1 back in July 2023, and at that time he didn’t know at what price Meta shares would be trading in February at 2024.

""But he did have the foresight to prepare for it by setting up Rule 10b5-1 to accelerate selling at certain prices,"" Silverman added.

However, Silverman did say that since companies offer special stock options annually to their executives, insiders usually do not need to worry about their company stock price while selling it. Silverman said insiders can often build up “enormous equity exposure” easily.

Silverman’s point regarding insider selling is also backed by academic research. In a paper titled Insider Trading: Frequency Matters, researchers talked about how many insiders use informational advantage while selling shares under the Rule10b5-1. Here is an important excerpt from the study:

""One US example involves selling shares through preprogrammed 10b5-1 plans, a process that on its face might suggest an orderly series of sales over time, but in reality, is often designed to facilitate large sales at the first opportunity. There is evidence that 10b5-1 preprogrammed selling occurs disproportionately before negative earnings surprises (Jagolinzer, 2008) and can predict share price decline more than insider sales in general (Milian, 2016). Other studies find that selling insiders sometimes appear to work subtly with analysts around the timing of earnings revisions (Richardson, Teoh, & Wysocki, 2004), or otherwise massage earnings accrual information (Kraft, Lee, & Lopatta, 2014), or the timing of share repurchases (Bonaime & Ryngaert, 2013) and earnings restatements (Agrawal & Cooper, 2015) to support a stock price before a sale. There is also evidence that insiders sell well in advance of a default (Beneish, Press, & Vargas, 2012) or bankruptcy (Iqbal & Shetty, 2002), or alternatively, reduce selling ahead of receiving a takeover bid (Agrawal & Nasser, 2012). Not every subtle exit strategy involves selling; informationally motivated share disposal occurs through prepaid forward contracts (Jagolinzer, Matsunaga, & Young, 2007) and large charitable gifts (Yermack, 2009).""

Apple drops term 'state-sponsored' attacks from its threat notification policy

In This Article:

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Apple Inc has warned its users in India and 91 other countries that they were possible victims of a ""mercenary spyware attack,"" dropping the word ""state-sponsored"" it used in its previous alerts to refer to such malware attacks.

Apple discovered that attackers tried to ""remotely compromise the iPhone,"" it said in a notification email that was sent to targeted users and seen by Reuters.

The company had previously said on its website that its threat notifications were designed to inform and assist users who might have been targeted by ""state-sponsored attackers.""

But Apple's latest update posted on the website on Wednesday said the threat notifications were designed to help users ""who might have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks.""

It also noted that such attacks have been historically associated with state actors, including private companies developing mercenary spyware on their behalf, such as Pegasus spyware from Israeli firm NSO Group.

Apple's removal of the term ""state-sponsored"" from its description of threat notifications comes after it repeatedly faced pressure from the Indian government on linking such breaches to state actors, said a source with direct knowledge.

India's opposition politicians accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government of trying to hack into their mobile phones following Apple's messages in October that warned of ""state-sponsored"" attacks.

Apple held extensive talks with Indian officials before releasing the latest set of alerts, the source added. It was not clear if other governments have also raised similar concerns

Apple and the Indian government did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Mercenary spyware attacks are rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or malware, according to the notification email.

Apple has sent threat notifications such as these multiple times in a year since 2021, the notification email said, adding that it had notified users in more than 150 countries in total to date.

In response to mounting geopolitical tensions, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has boosted its iPhone production in India, reaching an impressive $14 billion in the last fiscal year. This surge signifies a doubling of the tech giant's output, underscoring a strategic move to lessen its reliance on China.

Apple's production escalation implies that now, nearly 14% of the company's flagship phones, or approximately one in seven, originate from India. This information is according to undisclosed sources close to the situation as reported by Bloomberg.

While China continues to be a vital player as Apple's foremost production site and largest international market, there are increasing challenges. These include stiff competition from Huawei and constraints on foreign technology, both of which have impacted Apple's revenue within China.

This boost in Indian manufacturing represents a significant victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration. The government has been actively courting international companies like Apple, offering financial incentives to lure high-end manufacturing to India. As a result, an estimated 150,000 direct jobs have been created at Apple's supplier facilities.

Leading the pack in India are Foxconn and Pegatron, responsible for assembling approximately 67% and 17% of India-produced iPhones, respectively, for the fiscal year ending March 2024.

The remainder of the production is managed by Wistron’s facility in Karnataka, now under the supervision of Tata Group. This facility is on course to establish one of India’s largest iPhone assembly operations. It's crucial to note that the $14 billion figure represents the factory value of these iPhones and not their retail prices.

AAPL,2024-04-08,"Have you been investing in FAANG stocks or even the “Magnificent 7,” which is a collection of tech-focused U.S.-based stocks? In 2013, four tech stocks stood out, earning the collective name, “FANG.” In 2017, the acronym expanded to encompass Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.

In 2023, the Magnificent 7 moniker emerged to describe an expanded group of tech stocks: Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Apple, Alphabet Inc. (formerly Google), Nvidia Corp., and Tesla.

But there’s another name savvy investors should know: GRANOLAS. These stocks don’t (necessarily) have anything to do with the crunchy treat preferred by hikers and healthy snack enthusiasts. Rather, they are 11 European-based companies that represent a broad cross-section of the market, ranging from luxury brands to biopharmaceutical companies.

In spite of being international brands, many are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet, they are not correlated strongly with the S&P 500, according to SeekingAlpha.com.

The stocks in the category are: GSK, Roche, ASML, Nestle, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, L’Oreal, LVMH, AstraZeneca, SAP, and Sanofi.

Today’s investors are finding multiple reasons to diversify their holdings into the GRANOLAS stocks.

GRANOLAS Stocks Have Outperformed the Market Since June 2022

This diverse collection of stocks has delivered 60% of the gains in the European stock market in the past year, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, and have outperformed the FAANG stocks for the past two years, Morningstar.com reported.

Plus, most of the stocks on the list deliver dividends of 2% to 2.5%.

They Provide Diversification

While tech stocks tend to fare well in the U.S., a portfolio made up of FAANG stocks doesn’t provide much diversification. On the other hand, the GRANOLAS stocks represent sectors ranging from consumer goods to fashion, technology and healthcare.

They also aren’t tied to the S&P 500 or Nasdaq index. If the bulk of your portfolio is filled with U.S.-based stocks, adding some shares of even a handful of the GRANOLAS could serve you well.

Because of the diversity of the companies on the list, the collection also shows less volatility than the Magnificent 7. “The realized volatility of the GRANOLAS is on average 2x lower than for the Magnificent 7,” Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer recently told SeekingAlpha.com.",0.2318046536796536,0.4068587662337662,Neutral,0.9984105825424194,0.5152092021400603

In an unprecedented move in India's private sector, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and its suppliers, including Foxconn, Tata Group, and Salcomp, are planning to build employee residential facilities, according to an ET report. This initiative echoes industrial housing models prevalent in China and Vietnam.

The project aims to construct over 78,000 housing units under a public-private partnership. Tamil Nadu, a state in southern India, will receive the major portion with around 58,000 units lined up.

Funding for the project will be a joint venture. The central government of India plans to finance 10-15% of the total cost, with the rest being covered by state governments and private players. The goal is to conclude the project by March 2025.

The State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT), Tata Group, and SPR India are driving this initiative. This project is a significant step towards improving worker efficiency and security, focusing particularly on the young female workforce predominant in this industry.

The initiative also aims to enhance the living standards of the employees, many of whom are migrants coping with extended commutes and housing difficulties.

Foxconn, Apple's principal iPhone supplier in India, plans to allocate nearly 35,000 of these units for its workforce, 75% of which are women.

Our Methodology

To select stocks for this list, we scoured the top stock picks as recommended by prominent financial websites like The Motley Fool, Forbes, Kiplinger, Investopedia, Morningstar, Zacks, Market Watch, and Business Insider. The top twenty consensus picks were then selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way.

In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

“Among our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels.

AI: A Consequential Technology

Artificial intelligence has taken the world by storm. AI has become one of the most exciting things to come out of the technology sector. As a result, some of the best AI stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others, are working the hardest to contribute to the AI race and maybe even lead it, have been attracting even larger amounts of investor attention. This is unsurprising, considering the immense growth AI has been undergoing. On February 14, George Lee, the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Office of Applied Innovation, discussed the growth potential of artificial intelligence, particularly with regard to geopolitics, and how geopolitics, in turn, may shape an AI-enabled future, on CNBC's ""Capital Connection."" Here are some of his comments:

""For me, where I specialize is really this intersection of generative AI and geopolitics. The rise of this new capability in the world is super consequential for countries and for regions, matters of economics, defense, and even culture itself, as Jensen Huang talked about the other day.""

On being asked how he expects machine intelligence to impact global growth, productivity, and the US-China conflict, Lee made the following comments:

""Well, our economists have called for a very significant impact, over a 10-year period, some 1.5% increase in global GDP as a result of this [AI]. Now, I think the important thing to reflect on that is that it's a 10 year interval. While this has arrived abruptly, it's hugely consequential and fascinating, it will take time for this to deepen its impact across economies around the world. And so, we're very focused on trying to monitor that, and I think, my personal view is that there is going to be remarkable productivity and economic gains emerging from this. There's also going to be an incredible leap in human creativity and productivity as we partner with machines just to address and solve challenges that have been prohibitively difficult in the past.""

According to Lee, humanity will likely evolve with machines and artificial intelligence, resulting in exceptional growth moving forward. He noted the following:

""In a sense, I think we will co-evolve with these machines, and look, we are very early days in this new generative AI revolution, but the pace of improvement, the trajectory of improvement, is so remarkable, that I think we do have to think pretty broadly about how we're going to co-exist with machines, how we're going to cooperate, and how, together, we can elevate humanity.""

Global Leaders in the AI Space

With the discussion on AI rapidly gaining speed and importance across the globe, many are beginning to wonder which global players will lead the way in this new global world order that is so heavily impacted by technology and artificial intelligence in particular. Lee gave his opinion on the matter of global leaders in the AI race as well. Here's what he had to say:

""The US and China have an early lead in this. Like other technology revolutions, such as the internet, a lot of this sprang from the US, both academic and commercial roots. China is somewhat challenged in this area, both because they're export-controlled away from some of the key technologies they need, and there's also this issue of the emergent quality of chatbots being somewhat threatening to regimes that are sensitive to social harmony and stability. But make no mistake, they are a formidable adversary and will be leaders in this space. You then have a series of countries, the EU, England, France, etc., who are going to be very consequential here, particularly in terms of regulation. Then you have countries that have a particular technology edge in this domain, those are places like Taiwan, South Korea, the Netherlands. And then, most interestingly, you have countries like the UAE... who have done extraordinary work in building their Falcon open source model, the work they've done around Arabic language foundation models, and just the general infrastructure investing they're doing.""

Considering the above highlights, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy, particularly the best small-cap AI stocks to buy now. These include some of the best cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.

GOOGL,2024-03-20,"In this article, we will look at the 12 best alternatives to a 4-year college. We have also discussed the decreasing value of college degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.

In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees due to several factors. One major reason is the rising cost of higher education, which has led many individuals to seek more affordable options. Additionally, the job market's evolving nature demands a broader range of skills and competencies, prompting a shift towards alternative pathways such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and online certifications.

However, it's essential to acknowledge the lasting benefits of a four-year college degree. Beyond providing specialized knowledge in a particular field, a bachelor's degree often cultivates critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable across various professions. Moreover, a college education opens doors to a broader range of career opportunities and typically leads to higher earning potential over the long term. In fact, there are easy college degrees that are quite high paying as well.

It is interesting to note that Liberal Arts is one of the easiest 4 year degrees to get. However, Liberal Arts is also one of the most useless associate degrees if you want high-paying jobs.

Moreover, data from the Burning Glass Institute highlights a decline in jobs requiring a college education, dropping from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021. Similarly, Gallup reports a stark decline in the percentage of young adults viewing college education as ""very important,"" plummeting from 74% to 41% within six years.

Companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are redefining hiring criteria, recognizing the value of life experiences over formal education. This sentiment is echoed in findings from Georgetown University, revealing that while a bachelor's degree holder may earn $2.8 million over a lifetime, non-degree holders can still expect $1.6 million in earnings, challenging conventional notions of the economic benefits of higher education.

Moreover, in 2016, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) introduced ""new collar"" roles, emphasizing transferable skills over bachelor's degrees. By 2020, 15% of hires included positions like application developer and cyber security specialist. In 2021, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) eliminated degree requirements for over half its US openings. The P-TECH program aided underprivileged students in acquiring tech skills and securing International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) internships. While International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) maintains lower degree requirements for roles like software QA engineer and network administrator, just 31% of software developer/engineer positions mandate a degree — the lowest among tech competitors per Burning Glass Institute data.

Furthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an average of 12 job changes over a career, emphasizing the importance of adaptable skills garnered from varied experiences. Initiatives such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s career certificates and innovative programs like Minerva University's immersive learning confirm the growing emphasis on experiential learning.

Another observation we tend to find is that inflation, whether in currency or credentials, obeys the principles of supply and demand. Just as rare items like vintage baseball cards command high prices due to scarcity, rare skills in the job market yield high wages. However, the widespread adoption of college degrees as a signaling tool has led to their devaluation. With 99.5 million Americans now holding bachelor's degrees, the once-esteemed credential has become commonplace. This phenomenon, known as credential inflation, sees jobs that once required only a high school diploma now demanding a bachelor's degree. Consequently, many recent graduates find themselves overqualified for low-paying jobs, contributing to underemployment rates. To read about unemployment rates, see the countries with the highest unemployment rates.

Our Methodology

To list the best alternatives to a 4-year college degree, we have looked at alternatives with 4 major traits. Firstly, we tried to include options that offered specialized training or are specific in nature. Secondly, we identified options that provided hand-on experience. Thirdly, we looked at degree alternatives that were largely accessible. Lastly, we selected alternatives that aligned with current industry demands and trends and hence, came with high employability chances. We tried to score each alternative out of a total of 40 on the basis of consensus about the presence of these traits. We utilized Reddit as our primary source of consensus. The list is presented in an ascending order.

By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.

The smaller class sizes can provide more personalized attention and support. Associate degrees can also lead to some of the highest paying jobs as well.

10. Start Freelancing

IM Score: 22

Freelancing offers flexibility, autonomy, and potentially higher income without the time and financial commitments of a four-year college degree. It allows individuals to capitalize on their skills immediately, gaining practical experience while networking and building a portfolio.

With the rise of remote work and digital platforms, freelancers can access global opportunities, transcending geographical limitations. In exceptional cases, it is one of the easiest and high paying alternatives to a 4 year college degree.

9. Get an Internship or an Entry Level Job

IM Score: 24

This is one of the best options other than college after high school as choosing to pursue an internship or an entry-level job over a 4-year college degree can offer several advantages. The real-world experience can often be more immediately applicable to a career path than theoretical learning in a college setting. To read more about this, see the highest paying entry level jobs with no experience.

8. Join Apprenticeship Programs

IM Score: 26

Apprenticeship programs are one of the most popular alternatives to college degree as offer hands-on experience and specialized training, often tailored to specific industries, providing immediate applicability of skills. For instance, in fields like software development, apprenticeships such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s apprenticeship program offer direct mentorship from industry experts, real-world projects, and potential job placement.

7. Get Microcredentials and Nanodegrees

IM Score: 27

Microcredentials and Nanodegrees offer focused, specialized learning tailored to immediate industry needs, providing a quicker pathway to acquiring relevant skills compared to a traditional 4-year degree. For instance, in fields like Data Science, professionals may opt for a Nanodegree in Machine Learning Engineer, which equips them with specific skills sought after in the industry. In 2024, it is definitely a good alternative to a 4 year college degree.

The Alpahebet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Udacity Nanodegree program offers courses in various fields like data science, artificial intelligence, and web development. Each Nanodegree typically consists of several courses, providing hands-on projects and personalized feedback. Learners can access video lectures, quizzes, and community support. Completion time varies, with programs ranging from 3 to 12 months.

6. Join the Military Services

IM Score: 30

Military service provides hands-on experience in a variety of roles, including technical, logistical, and tactical positions, which can translate directly into civilian careers. Additionally, the military often offers financial support for further education, including assistance with tuition fees and specialized training programs. Moreover, serving in the military can instill values like teamwork, resilience, and adaptability, which are highly valued in both professional and personal endeavors.

The roughly $300 million of proceeds, net of our capped call and deal fees, positions the company to exercise inorganic adoptions to further vertically integrate our supply chain with the critical capabilities that are consistent with what we have done successfully in the past, which has enabled larger and more strategic program wins like the recent $0.5 billion SDA program.

Cramer said that the latest news around TikTok could become a “tailwind” for the social media company. Cramer yet again praised Mark Zuckerberg. Cramer is also advising investors to keep holding Alphabet despite the notion that it is behind in the AI race. Cramer said that he’s holding onto Alphabet because of what the company “can” do instead of what it’s currently doing. He thinks Alphabet has a lot of “optionality.”

Jim Cramer also talked about what he called the “new industrial revolution,” referring to major tech and AI plays. As expected, Cramer yet again highlighted the juggernaut that is Nvidia and said the company’s high performance chips have made it a monopoly in the industry and it would take a long time for other companies to catchup. Cramer said this monopoly was “born” because of “sweat, blood and tears” of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team.

Jim Cramer also said that the AI revolution is giving rise to a plethora of new applications and ecosystems which would help many companies in relevant sectors.

Jim Cramer advised investors to go in a “wait and see” mode and process the upcoming CPI and PPI reports before reaching to any conclusions about the Fed’s possible path in its battle against inflation.

Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on.

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

In 2023, the world's top 20 hedge funds delivered significant returns of $67 billion, tripling the previous year's performance, as reported by LCH Investments in January 2024. TCI Fund Management, headed by billionaire Christopher Hohn, led the group with $12.9 billion in returns after fees. On average, the top 20 managers achieved a 10.5% gain in 2023, surpassing the industry's overall return of 6.4%. Multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, Millennium Management, and D. E. Shaw, known for using leverage, were the top three funds by lifetime gains. Despite representing only 4.6% of the industry's assets, these three firms generated 38.3% of the industry's returns over the past three years. Citadel, with $74 billion in gains since 1990, maintained its leading position in 2023, returning 15.3%, while also deciding to return approximately $7 billion to investors. Pershing Square, led by William Ackman, re-entered the rankings for the first time since 2015, securing the 20th position with $18.8 billion in returns since 2004, and achieving a return of 26.7% in 2023, outperforming the broader stock market. On the other hand, Bridgewater Associates and Caxton Associates were the only firms among the top 20 that posted losses. The strong performance in 2023 followed a challenging 2022 marked by market turbulence due to the war in Ukraine and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The top 20 hedge funds have collectively generated substantial profits, totaling $755.4 billion since their inception, surpassing their total managed assets of $655.5 billion, according to the research findings.

Brad Amiee, Director and Head of Research at LCH Investments, attributes the success of leading hedge funds in 2023 to the impressive performance of the stock market during the year. He noted that in addition to benefiting from the overall positive market conditions, many of these funds demonstrated particularly astute stock selection strategies. In a statement to Financial Times, Amiee said:

“You could argue that, since shorting is such a challenging sub-strategy, keeping things long-biased and having a concentrated portfolio of high quality positions has been the way to go.”

The robust performance of top financiers correlates with the overall stock market rally in 2023, particularly benefiting hedge funds that focus on specific stock picks. Many in the industry have heavily invested in the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. However, concerns are rising on Wall Street about the concentration of investments in these same companies. The data highlights a growing disparity in the hedge fund industry, with the top 20 firms managing just under 19% of the total $3.5 trillion assets but representing 46% of the sector's cumulative gains.

In 2024, global hedge funds are facing pressure to enhance returns due to a robust stock rally and increased bond yields, aiming to counteract investor outflows. Last year, investors withdrew a net $75 billion from hedge funds, following a significant outflow of $112 billion in 2022. Investors, seeking double-digit returns in 2024, are interested in credit, global macro, commodity, and equity long/short strategies. Some potential approaches include adopting ""barbell"" portfolios and exploring bond-trading strategies, given the potential impact of rising rates on refinancing costs for companies. Hedge funds focusing on diverse macroeconomic signals are also gaining attention, particularly as central banks are expected to adjust monetary policies.

Some of the most owned stocks by hedge funds include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Jackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

GOOGL,2024-03-04,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 16 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years. You can also directly check the 5 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years.

Consumer markets are dynamic and the introduction of new products represents both opportunity and risk for businesses. Over the past five years, numerous products have faced challenges and ultimately failed to achieve sustainable success in the marketplace. The unprecedented global event, COVID-19 pandemic, disrupted supply chains, altered consumer preferences, and reshaped the competitive landscape, posing formidable challenges for businesses across various industries.

According to McKinsey & Company, nearly 90% of companies experienced supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, significantly impacting their ability to deliver products effectively. Publicly traded companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) reported revenue declines as a result of these disruptions, highlighting the widespread impact on corporate performance.

Moreover, consumer behavior underwent significant changes during the pandemic, with a notable shift towards online shopping and digital consumption. A report by Adobe found that online sales surged by 32% in 2020 compared to the previous year, as consumers increasingly turned to e-commerce channels for their shopping needs. This shift accelerated the adoption of digital products and services while posing challenges for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and physical product-based businesses

In addition to pandemic-related challenges, businesses launching new products faced intensifying competition and higher consumer expectations in terms of quality, innovation, and value proposition. Nielsen research suggests that consumer trust in brands and products has become increasingly influenced by factors such as sustainability, social responsibility, and transparency.

From high-profile tech gadgets to innovative consumer goods, each product faced unique challenges that contributed to the downfall of products launched by many popular companies. For instance, publicly traded companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) faced setbacks with products like Google Pixel 4, which failed to impress consumers and critics due to mediocre battery life and lack of innovative features.

Therefore, Innovation remains a key driver of competitive advantage in today's business landscape. However, innovation without adequate market research, consumer insights, and risk assessment can lead to costly missteps. By analyzing the root causes of product failures and learning from past mistakes, businesses can refine their innovation processes, enhance product development strategies, and better align offerings with customer needs and preferences.

Moreover, collaboration and partnerships with external stakeholders, such as suppliers, distributors, and industry experts, can provide valuable insights and resources to support product development efforts. By fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, companies can leverage external expertise and perspectives to identify potential pitfalls and optimize product strategies.

In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and unprecedented global disruptions, businesses must remain agile, adaptable, and customer-centric to navigate the turbulent waters of the modern marketplace. Through a thorough understanding of past failures and a commitment to continuous improvement, businesses can position themselves for sustainable growth and success in the ever-changing business landscape.

Let's move to the list for the 16 failed products in the last 5 years.

Methodology

Our methodology for identifying the 16 failed products in the last 5 years involved conducting thorough research using Business Insider, Inc., 24/7 Wall St, Listverse, The Verge, and Boredpanda. We selected the 16 failed products in the last 5 years on a structured scoring system. Each product received points based on the times it appeared in the research sources.

16. LG G8 ThinQ (2019)

Score: 1

LG's flagship smartphone, the G8 ThinQ, boasted innovative features such as Hand ID and Air Motion gestures, aiming to differentiate itself in a crowded market. However, these features failed to resonate with consumers, who perceived them as gimmicky rather than practical. Additionally, the G8 ThinQ's design and specifications failed to stand out against competitors offering similar or superior performance at a lower price point. LG's marketing efforts struggled to effectively communicate the device's value proposition, resulting in lackluster sales and market penetration. The G8 ThinQ's failure led to the challenges of competing in the highly competitive smartphone market without delivering compelling innovation or value to consumers.

15. LG Rollable Smartphone (2021)

Score: 2

LG's rollable smartphone prototype, showcased with much anticipation at CES 2021, generated excitement for its innovative form factor and potential to redefine mobile device design.

The rollable smartphone, which was poised to offer users a unique and flexible display experience, garnered praise for its forward-thinking design and engineering. However, LG's strategic pivot away from smartphones raised doubts about the company's commitment to innovation in the mobile industry. The cancellation of the rollable smartphone project disappointed consumers eagerly awaiting its release and underscored the challenges of executing ambitious projects in rapidly evolving markets.

14. Sony Xperia 1 (2019)

Score: 2

Sony's Xperia 1 entered the smartphone market with a focus on delivering premium features and a cinematic viewing experience. However, the device failed to gain traction among consumers due to several shortcomings. Despite its high price tag, the Xperia 1 offered lackluster camera performance compared to competitors in the same price range. Additionally, its limited availability through select carriers and retailers restricted its reach to potential buyers. The Xperia 1 also faced criticism for its tall and narrow form factor, which made it less comfortable to hold and operate compared to other smartphones. Despite Sony's reputation for quality and innovation in consumer electronics, the Xperia 1 failed to attract consumers looking for a flagship smartphone with a compelling value proposition, resulting in disappointing sales and market performance making it a failed product.

13. Uber Jump Electric Bikes (2019)

Score: 2

Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s ambitious venture into electric bike-sharing aimed to offer users a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. However, the service encountered numerous challenges that hindered its success. Regulatory issues, including permitting requirements and restrictions on where bikes could be parked, varied across different cities, leading to operational complexities and limited availability in certain areas. Moreover, vandalism and theft of Jump bikes posed significant financial burdens for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), requiring constant maintenance and replacement efforts. Operational challenges such as battery management and bike redistribution further strained the viability of the service. Despite initial enthusiasm for electric bike-sharing as a sustainable transportation solution, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s struggles with Jump bikes showed the complexities of implementing urban mobility initiatives amidst regulatory hurdles and operational challenges.

12. Google Pixel 4 (2019)

Score: 3

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google Pixel 4 flagship smartphone failed to meet expectations set by its predecessors, facing criticism for several shortcomings. Despite Google's reputation for innovative software, the Pixel 4 disappointed users and critics alike with its underwhelming battery life, which struggled to last through a full day of use. Additionally, the device lacked groundbreaking features to differentiate itself from competitors in the crowded smartphone market. The Pixel 4's high price tag, coupled with its lackluster hardware specifications relative to its competitors, deterred potential buyers seeking value for money. Moreover, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s decision to omit a fingerprint sensor in favor of facial recognition technology received mixed reviews, with some users expressing concerns about its reliability and security. The Pixel 4's lackluster reception underscored the challenges of competing in the fiercely competitive smartphone market without delivering significant innovation or value proposition to consumers.

11. Nintendo Labo (2018-2019)

Score: 3

Nintendo Labo was an innovative concept that combined do-it-yourself cardboard accessories with interactive gaming experiences for the Nintendo Switch console. Launched with multiple kits offering various gameplay possibilities, Nintendo Labo initially generated excitement among gamers and families. However, the novelty of the cardboard construction and limited replay value led to waning interest after the initial launch period. Despite offering unique gaming experiences, Nintendo Labo failed to maintain momentum due to its high price point relative to its perceived value. The lack of ongoing support and updates for new Labo kits further limited its appeal and contributed to its decline in popularity. While Nintendo Labo showcased Nintendo's creativity and commitment to innovation, its failure to sustain interest laid the foundation of the challenges of introducing new gaming concepts into a competitive market without addressing fundamental user needs and preferences.

10. Segway PT (Personal Transporter) (2001-2020)

Score: 3

Marketed as a revolutionary mode of personal transportation, the Segway PT garnered widespread attention upon its debut. With its self-balancing technology and sleek design, the Segway promised to transform urban commuting and personal mobility. However, its high price tag and niche appeal limited its adoption beyond certain niche markets, such as tourism and security. Additionally, concerns over safety and regulatory restrictions hindered widespread adoption of the Segway PT in urban environments. Despite attempts to diversify its product lineup and target new consumer segments, Segway struggled to overcome its image as a novelty or luxury item. The company's decision to discontinue production of the Segway PT in 2020 marked the end of an era for the iconic personal transporter.

9. Google+ (2011-2019)

Score: 4

Google+ was Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s ambitious venture into social networking, aiming to challenge Facebook's dominance. Launched with features like Circles for personalized sharing and Hangouts for group video calls, Google+ initially attracted a significant user base. However, it failed to maintain momentum due to complex user interface and integration issues with other Google services. Moreover, the platform's struggle with identity management and the lack of killer features compared to existing social networks hampered its growth. Security breaches, including one in 2018 that exposed users' private data, further undermined trust in the platform. Despite efforts to revitalize it, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced the closure of Google+ in 2019, citing low user engagement and the challenge of addressing security concerns.

8. Amazon Echo Loop (2019)

Score: 4

Amazon's Echo Loop represented the company's foray into wearable technology with a smart ring featuring Alexa integration. However, the device failed to gain traction among consumers due to its limited functionality and uncomfortable design. Despite offering basic voice assistant capabilities, the Echo Loop lacked the versatility and utility of other Echo devices, such as smart speakers and displays. Additionally, its bulky and conspicuous design made it impractical for everyday wear, limiting its appeal to consumers seeking a seamless and unobtrusive smart assistant experience. Despite Amazon's marketing efforts, the Echo Loop failed to resonate with consumers, highlighting the challenges of introducing new form factors into the wearable tech market without addressing key user needs and preferences.

7. Google Stadia (2019)

Score: 4

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google Stadia aimed to revolutionize the gaming industry by offering cloud-based gaming experiences accessible across various devices without the need for high-end hardware. Promising seamless gameplay and instant access to a library of titles, Stadia generated significant excitement upon its announcement. However, the platform faced numerous challenges, including a limited game library at launch and performance issues such as input lag and latency. Furthermore, the subscription model and pricing structure for games on Stadia were confusing for consumers, leading to uncertainty and hesitancy to adopt the platform. Despite Google's investment in infrastructure and partnerships with game developers, Stadia failed to gain widespread adoption and faced criticism from both gamers and industry analysts.

6. Google Clips (2018-2019)

Score: 4

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI-powered camera, Google Clips, aimed to capture candid moments using machine learning algorithms. However, the device failed to gain widespread adoption due to concerns over privacy and limited functionality. Despite Google's efforts to position Clips as a convenient and innovative camera accessory, its reception fell short of expectations. Consumers were apprehensive about the device's always-on recording capabilities, raising privacy concerns in homes and public spaces. Moreover, the device's limited functionality and lack of user control over content creation limited its appeal to consumers seeking more versatile photography solutions. Despite Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s attempt to cater to a niche market segment with Clips, its failure to address fundamental user concerns and deliver compelling features resulted in lackluster sales and market reception.

GOOGL,2024-03-01,"Roundhill Investments, the thematic ETF issuer with $870.7 million in assets, is doubling down on the Magnificent Seven with a pair of funds, including one for bets the stocks will rise and the other for investors who want to profit on their decline.

The asset manager known for its metaverse and gaming exchange-traded funds launched the Roundhill Daily 2X Long Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGX), which offers twice the daily performance of the famed seven tech equities, by investing at least 80% of its portfolio in equal weight exposure to Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Tesla Inc. The Roundhill Daily Inverse Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGQ) give inverse exposure to the same basket of stocks.

The funds, which began trading today, are designed for ""sophisticated traders,"" the company said in a statement. MAGX dropped 1.6% to $25.15 in afternoon trading while MAGQ rose 0.1% to $24.86.

The seven stocks were coined the “Magnificent Seven” as they largely drove the bull market that started last year. The group makes up about a quarter of the value of the 3,700 or so publicly traded U.S. companies. Fueled by artificial intelligence excitement and the launch of AI products such as Chat GPT, investors bet big on chipmakers like Nvidia and chatbot creators such as Microsoft.

“We saw an opportunity to provide both investors and traders with the full toolkit to express their opinion on the Magnificent Seven,” explained Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer of Roundhill in an interview with etf.com about the new launches.

The launch follows the November conversion of Roundhill's BIGT fund into the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which has not had a day of outflows so far this year, pulling in $106.2 million while gaining 13%, according to etf.com data.

While MAGS is for investors, MAGX and MAGQ is for traders, Mazza said.

“Particularly the 2x version is only appropriate for traders who have the ability to monitor their positions on a daily basis,” explained Mazza.

In today's dynamic business environment, attracting top talent requires more than just competitive salaries; it demands a comprehensive benefits package that will address the diverse needs of a modern workforce. Companies that offer various perks not only enhance their attractiveness as employers but also leverage these benefits as strategic tools for business growth and sustainability.

This is evidenced by the fact that organizations recognized for their superior employee benefits often report lower turnover rates, translating to significant cost savings in recruitment and training. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 56% of US employees consider employer-sponsored health benefits when deciding to stay in their current job. When it comes to identifying the best employee benefits companies, it's important to explore various sectors, including tech giants and manufacturing firms. This helps in understanding how innovative benefits can shape business outcomes and employee satisfaction. The companies that lead in this realm not only offer traditional perks but also prioritize the holistic well-being of both full-time and part-time employees.

Workplace Evolution: Changing Expectations of Today's Workers

A Microsoft survey from 2021 found that 41% of workers globally were thinking about leaving their jobs within the next year, showing how people's expectations from their workplaces are changing. Health benefits are now crucial for employee satisfaction, as highlighted in another 2021 Glassdoor survey where 40% of the respondents said health insurance is the most important benefit.

GOOGL,2024-02-26,"In this article, we discuss the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the financial markets and expert outlook, go directly to the 5 Stocks That Will Make You Rich In 2024.

So far, the Fed’s efforts have managed to contain the inflation and is expected to push the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession like the European countries such as the U.K. and Germany experienced.

Last year was another strange year for the market as it was believed that the US economy would go into a recession. However, the complete opposite happened, and the S&P 500 was able to manage gains of over 25%. While it is believed that growth stocks usually perform well during interest rate cuts and have bearish outcomes during economic downturns, the economy was saved by the technology sector, which is dominated by growth stocks. Companies like Nvidia and Meta saw triple-digit growth and are still up 63.63% and 39.78% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of market closing on February 23.

It is important to note that while it is a popular belief that AI and semiconductor stocks were the top performers of the year, it is not entirely true. Blockchain and crypto news were wildly overshadowed by the AI revolution. Some of the best-performing ETFs included Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) and Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI). However, cryptocurrencies have shown a significant amount of volatility in the first two months of the year.

While the Fed has not been clear on its rate-cutting position in 2024, experts believe that it might start in the first half of the year, which means that growth stocks might make you rich in 2024. Although experts still have mixed opinions about the current year, you can still take a look at 14 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Right Now, which also contains a list of stocks with the potential to make you rich in 2024.

2024 Outlook According to Analysts

Even though 2023 was a great year for the market, many analysts believe that the current year might not be as great and should be an average year. It shouldn’t come as a surprise as the news of a soft landing has been spreading around. The “average year” analysis is provided by Morgan Stanley, which believes in it due to normalizing financial conditions, excessive valuations, and a few other factors. The firm suggests maintaining a preference for value stocks as compared to growth stocks at least till the first rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

On the other hand, B.Riley and JP Morgan have quite bullish views about the future of the market. One of their main concerns is the over-valuation of stocks due to the 2023 rally. JP Morgan warns about a potential 20% to 30% dip in the market, while B. Riley Strategist Paul Dietrich predicts a mild recession, which could steer the market toward a 40% decline.

While most analysts believe in a mediocre market performance this year, there are still some investments that can make you rich. For this purpose, we created a list of stocks that could make you rich in 2024, and some of them include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).

GOOGL,2024-02-25,"In this article, we will take a look at the 15 states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024. If you would like to skip our discussion on the US economy, you can go to the 5 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024.

While headlines boast of a historically low national unemployment rate of 3.7% in 2023, there have been massive layoffs totaling 19.8 million during the last year as compared to 17.6 million layoffs in 2022. In January 2024, 82,307 job cuts were announced, which is an increase of 136% from December 2023. Moreover, many different companies across the USA have announced job cuts this year in order to curtail rising costs amid uncertain economic conditions. In fact, a survey conducted by The Conference Board revealed that 23% of the CEOs are planning to lay off employees in the next 12 months. This is 13% more than in the previous quarter.

The brunt of these layoffs is not evenly distributed across sectors. Technology companies, while navigating the current economic uncertainty, are witnessing a significant number of job cuts. In January 2024 alone, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced 5% job cuts in its audiobooks and podcast division, 35% in the streaming unit, and several hundred in the streaming and studio operations. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also announced hundreds of layoffs in the same month. So far, more than 140 companies in the tech space have laid off over 34,000 employees in 2024. In 2023, more than 1,160 tech companies laid off 262,000 employees. The major reason for the significant number of layoffs is the slowdown after the hiring spree within the sector in recent years.

Here's what Baron Funds said about Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:

“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares of Amazon were up 19.5% in the quarter and finished the year up 80.9%. Reported quarterly results were better than consensus estimates with 11% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, a significant beat in North American operating profit as operating margins reached 4.9% and a recovery in the cloud division, AWS, which grew 12% year-over-year and management reported that the impact of customer optimizations was attenuating. We believe that AWS has many years of growth ahead as IT budgets continue switching from on premise to the cloud and as Amazon remains the clear leader in the market, with large incremental opportunities in application software, including enabling GenAI workloads. We also believe Amazon is well positioned in the short-to-medium term to further improve core North American retail profitability to above pre-pandemic levels, benefiting from its new regionalized fulfillment network and its growing margin-accretive advertising business. Longer term, Amazon has substantially more room to grow in e-commerce, where it has less than 15% penetration of the total addressable market.”

Media is another industry that has reported many job cuts recently. In 2023, 20,324 layoffs were announced in this industry. Many big names in media have announced layoffs in 2024, including Business Insider (8% of staff), Los Angeles Times (94 journalists), and Paramount Global (3% of the workforce). The main reason is the rise in popularity of the Internet as a one-stop shop for advertisers. Moreover, consumers are becoming more price-conscious as far as news or informational articles are concerned. Other industries announcing a significant number of layoffs include retail and even automotive. The drop in consumer spending, especially in retail, and the demand for a better bottom line have both led to a drive to cut costs, thereby cutting jobs.

In addition to variation by industry, there is a lot of disparity in the unemployment rate by state. The lowest unemployment rate by state in 2023 was in Maryland, and the highest unemployment rate by state in the same year was in Nevada. In this scenario, unemployment benefits serve as a crucial safety net, providing temporary financial assistance to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. However, unemployment benefits by state vary significantly in terms of nature and duration, highlighting stark disparities in how different regions address unemployment. Each state has a different methodology for calculating unemployment benefits as well as the employment tax rate, which provides the funds for these benefits.

Our Methodology

To compile our list of the 15 states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024, we made use of three weighted metrics, namely the average weekly benefit (weight of 0.4), cost of living index (weight of 0.3), and the number of weeks these benefits extend (weight of 0.3). We then ranked the worst states for unemployment benefits on all three of these metrics. Then, we computed a weighted average of states' rankings across these three criteria and adjusted the final rankings accordingly. The states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024 have been ranked in descending order of their scores.

15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024

15. Connecticut

Weighted Average Score: 7.2

Connecticut provides unemployment benefits for a period of 26 weeks. The state achieved a noteworthy milestone in economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in November 2023, when employment levels surpassed pre-pandemic levels.

14. Maine

Weighted Average Score: 7.1

Maine experienced an increase in its unemployment rate, reaching 3.2% in January 2024. Despite this upward trend for the fifth consecutive month, the rate remained lower than the overall US unemployment rate and marked the lowest rate on record for the state. However, Maine's unemployment insurance system has faced challenges in meeting the needs of its citizens.

13. Arkansas

Weighted Average Score: 7.1

Arkansas ranks thirteenth on the list of states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024. In addition to the low cap on unemployment benefits, the maximum duration of the benefits in Arkansas is also short as compared to the standard 26 weeks practiced in many states. The unemployment rate in Arkansas was 3.4% in December 2023.

12. Virginia

Weighted Average Score: 6.8

As of February 2023, the unemployment insurance program in Virginia offers a maximum of 26 weeks of benefits. The benefit amounts vary, starting from a minimum of $60 per week and reaching a maximum of $378 per week. Virginia infrequently revisits its unemployment benefits structure. However, the state has a low unemployment rate, which was recorded at 2.7% in December 2023.

11. District of Columbia

Weighted Average Score: 6.7

In December 2023, the unemployment rate in the District of Columbia was 5.1%, showing a 0.1% increase from November 2023 and remaining higher than other states. The District of Employment Services (DOES) has faced widespread criticism for delays in processing unemployment benefit claims amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this criticism, DOES has revamped its unemployment insurance benefits system to simplify the application process and address issues related to fraud.

10. Tennessee

Weighted Average Score: 6.2

With an unemployment rate of 3.5% in December 2023, Tennessee is another state with an average unemployment rate and low unemployment benefits. The unemployment benefits in Tennessee are less than the minimum wage. This leaves the unemployed with hardly any money for sustenance.

9. South Carolina

Weighted Average Score: 6.1

South Carolina faces challenges in its unemployment benefits system, not only offering low benefits but also presenting complexities in the application process. With a complex system in place, only 14.8% of the unemployed population manages to access unemployment benefits in the state. Furthermore, South Carolina's eligibility period for unemployment benefits stands at 20 weeks, which is shorter compared to the standard 26 weeks practiced in many states.

8. New Hampshire

Weighted Average Score: 5.8

The unemployment rate in New Hampshire was recorded at just 2.5% in December 2023, lower than the national average. While the state’s economy managed to rebound from the COVID-19 recession in a fairly short amount of time, the rising cost of living has increased the citizen’s hardships.

7. California

Weighted Average Score: 5.8

In California, the unemployment rate rose to 5.1% in December 2023. Approximately one in four unemployment benefits claims were rejected during the pandemic for various reasons. Additionally, California's unemployment benefits have not been updated for over two decades and do not adequately cover the cost of living. Hence, California is considered one of the states with the worst unemployment benefits. Silicon Valley, situated in California's Bay Area, continues to be the largest tech hub, with companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) located there.

6. Delaware

Weighted Average Score: 5.7

In Delaware, a bill was recently passed to improve the state’s unemployment benefits, which have been constant since 2019. As of December 2023, the unemployment rate in Delaware stands at 4.20%, indicating no change from the previous month and a decrease from the 4.60% recorded in 2022. This figure is also below the long-term average of 5.25%.

GOOGL,2024-02-25,"In this article, we discuss the 11 cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence industry, go directly to the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit the ground running since last year, and there seems to be no end in sight to it in the near future. The PwC Emerging Technology Survey suggests that after the launch of ChatGPT, more than half of the surveyed companies have introduced generative AI in some form to their business. The AI stocks also performed quite well in 2023 and are still trending in 2024. The Magnificent 7 stocks outperformed the rest of the S&P 493 heavily in the year, and analysts like Goldman Sachs' David Kostin are positive that the gains will continue in 2024. The seven big tech stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which were the top performers of the group, collectively gained around 75% during the previous year compared to 12% gains for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index.

Other than the big tech, AI technology gave a boost to a range of AI companies. The Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (IGPT) gained over 30% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 25% growth. Moreover, the ETF is also 15.80% higher year-to-date (YTD) at the time of the February 23 market close, compared to the S&P 500’s 7.3% gains.

AI is changing the face of every sector in the market. For example, the mortgage finance company Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE:RKT) uses AI for mortgage banking, underwriting, and servicing. In 2023, The company piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers and outbound client calls.

In addition, the real estate company Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) sets up networks and data centers, making it quite exposed to potential growth in AI computer facilities. At the company’s Q4 2023 earnings call CEO Charles Meyers said:

“We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.

Effects of AI on Labor

An International Monetary Fund (IMF) report defines AI as a double-edged sword. While AI can potentially create many jobs, it can also replace human labor in several other areas. The IMF believes that nearly 40% of the jobs around the world are exposed to AI. In the developed countries, 60% of the jobs will be affected by the new technology creating a higher risk/reward situation for their labor markets. However, the report mentions that wealthier countries are also better equipped to adopt AI.

For emerging economies and under-developed nations, the IMF suggests laying concrete groundwork and infrastructure to be better prepared for the AI revolution in the job market.

The artificial intelligence industry is on the rise, and it’s significantly far away from its peak. This creates some entry points for investors in cheap AI companies. Keeping that in mind, some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024 include Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).

Our Methodology

For this article, we identified 30 stocks trading on NYSE and NASDAQ that directly benefit from the rise of AI or are actively working for the growth of the artificial intelligence space. Next, we chose the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside as of February 23. The analyst price targets were taken from TipRanks. We only chose the companies that were covered by at least two analysts and didn’t have many Hold or Sell ratings, as compared to Buy-equivalent ratings. The 11 best cheap AI stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside.

We also added the number of hedge fund investors for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Analysts

11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 11.40%

Average Analyst Price Target: $196.65

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) takes the 11th spot on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy. It produces semiconductor devices and its products, including AMD Vitis AI platform, MI300, and Ryzen 8040 laptop processors are driven by and designed for AI applications.

34 Wall Street analysts covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) over the last three months, and 29 maintained a Buy rating on the stock. As of the February 23 market close, the average price target of $196.65 represented an upside of 11.40%.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, along with Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.95%

Average Analyst Price Target: $206.15

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is famously known for its signature consumer electronics and more, but it has been working tirelessly to integrate AI and machine learning into its products.

On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable by February 15 to the shareholders of record on February 12. The stock’s dividend yield was 0.53% as of the February 23 market close.

Mairs & Power mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“The Fund’s relative performance was negatively impacted by what we didn’t own as well. In particular, not holding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for most of the year cost the Fund more than 300bps (basis points) of performance. Apple may be the best-known company in the world and its seemingly ubiquitous iPhone holds a dominant share of the global cell phone market. Apple is even more dominant among Millennials and Gen Zers, which should lead to even greater market share as these cohorts age. This loyal user base should pay huge dividends for shareholders as Apple continues to monetize this ecosystem, especially as the company delves deeper into services, payments, and AI. We initiated a position in Apple during the fourth quarter and await a more attractive entry point to add to our position.”

9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.33%

Average Analyst Price Target: $164.59

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 214

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest tech holding companies and has many AI-driven products under its belt, including Bard, Gemini 1.5, and more.

On February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) introduced its new next-generation AI model, named Gemini 1.5. The mid-size multimodal model is set to be released for testing soon and will be called the Gemini 1.5 Pro version.

According to Insider Monkey’s database which tracks 933 elite hedge funds, 214 funds had investments in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock in the fourth quarter. With 45.22 million shares worth $6.3 billion, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management was the top investor in the company.

First Pacific Advisors stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”

8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.44%

Average Analyst Price Target: $469.58

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 302

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been long making headlines in the AI industry with its investments in AI companies and AI products like Azure AI.

On February 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith took to Twitter and announced that the company would be investing $2.1 billion over the next two years to develop the AI infrastructure in Spain.

On February 15, it was reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning on furthering the AI infrastructure in Germany through an investment of 3.2 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in the next two years.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was mentioned in Baron Funds’ fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Our biggest purchase in the fourth quarter was a new position we initiated in the software platform Microsoft Corporation. While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund, we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy. However, Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric, on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers. Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly. Over time, Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share, while becoming a more important driver for the company. For example, in the last quarterly earnings release, Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors. A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year. Just to put this in perspective, $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business, it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue. We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner, global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $4.7 trillion worldwide IT spending.

7. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 17.66%

Average Analyst Price Target: $122.30

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20

Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a California-based company that designs and sells user interface solutions, and many of them are integrated with AI, like its Smart Home SoC solution. It ranks seventh on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.

On February 9, Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy raised the price target on Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)’s stock to $130 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.

On February 8, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) released its Q2 earnings result with a non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, which beat the estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $237 million topped the estimates by $1.33 million.

TimesSquare Capital Management made the following comment about Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:

“In the Information Technology sector, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) develops and markets semiconductor product solutions. Their products enable users to interact more easily with smartphones, notebooks, tablets, and other portable multi-media devices. While the fiscal third quarter results were in line with sell-side projections, forward guidance was worse than expected. Management sees growing macroeconomic headwinds further impacting IT budgets, and the inventory draw-down has been slower than they had anticipated on weaker sell-through trends. Synaptics lost -23% and we added to the position.”

6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 18.07%

Average Analyst Price Target: $653.43

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a California-based company that manufactures and sells computer software and its Adobe Sensei is just one feather among many in its hat when it comes to AI technology.

In the fourth quarter, 105 hedge funds owned a stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s stock. Fisher Asset Management was the most significant stakeholder in the company, with 4.56 million shares worth $2.72 billion, representing 1.33% of the portfolio.

Out of 30 Wall Street analysts that covered Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the last three months, 24 kept a Buy rating on the stock. The average price target of $653.43 had an upside of 18.07% as of the February 23 market close.

Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) are some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, besides Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).

Polen Capital commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

As we navigate through 2024, the outlook for both the stock and bond markets experiences regular fluctuations, driven by a myriad of factors including economic data releases, Federal Reserve communications, and shifts in interest rate forecasts. Initially, investors anticipated multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve over the year, with expectations of the first cut occurring in March. However, in light of a string of favorable economic indicators, the Fed has signaled that a rate cut in March is unlikely. As a result, investors are recalibrating their assessments of stocks and bonds, anticipating fewer rate cuts to commence at a later date than previously anticipated.

The Commerce Department's report on economic growth reveals a 3.1% year-over-year expansion in the fourth quarter of 2023, fueled by robust consumer spending in sectors like healthcare, dining, and automobiles. This robust performance, combined with potential future rate cuts, has bolstered market sentiment, with bulls expressing optimism and setting higher targets for the S&P 500 index. Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, suggested that the S&P 500 could reach 6,100 in the long term if new highs are reached. Despite certain stocks being overbought, Stockton highlighted signs of market strength, signaling the start of a bull market.

On a contrasting note, analysts with a long-term perspective anticipate that the Federal Reserve will eventually commence rate cuts. At the same time, robust earnings growth and economic resilience will propel the S&P 500 upward towards the end of 2024. Goldman Sachs has recently revised its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,200, an increase from its earlier projection of 5,100. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs anticipates that the robust earnings performance of mega-cap stocks, particularly those within the Magnificent Seven group, will play a significant role in driving S&P 500 profits in 2024.

Given the circumstances outlined above, it’s no wonder that renowned companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remain top contenders as some of the best revenue stocks to invest in, both in the eyes of analysts and investors.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google has told suppliers to start making its Pixel smartphones in India by next quarter at the earliest, as part of its plan to ship more than 10 million Pixel phones this year, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday.

Google would start manufacturing smartphones in India and its flagship Pixel 8 will be available in 2024, it said last October, as it focuses more on a key growth market.

The move will also help Google diversify its supply chain away from China, the Nikkei report said, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

The tech giant will prepare production lines for its high-end Pixel 8 Pro smartphones in the coming weeks and start producing phones in the April-June quarter, the report added, citing multiple sources.

The report did not say how many phones Google plans to manufacture India nor if the phones will be for sale in the country or for exports.

Google did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Top 15 MBA Interview Questions, According to Experts

Securing an MBA interview is a huge accomplishment—and often it means you’re close to the finish line.

“While some MBA programs interview all applicants, in most cases getting asked to interview is a sign that your application and profile are compelling, and the admissions committee can see a potential place for you in the upcoming class,” Erin Wand, an admissions consultant at mba.com, says.

Preparing for your interview beforehand is key to success. The experts at simplilearn recently compiled a list of the top MBA interview questions that admissions officers use to determine whether or not you are the right fit for their B-school.

“TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF”

This question is usually asked as a conversation starter to better understand your background, experience, and accomplishments. Try to limit your response to two to three minutes and prepare essential talking points beforehand including: Your undergraduate experience and why you chose the major that you did, work experience and accomplishments from the past and present, and your career objectives.

“WHAT MOTIVATES YOU TO PURSUE AN MBA?”

With this question, admissions officers are trying to see whether or not you have a well-thought-out approach to your MBA journey. Explaining the “why” is key to answering this question clearly.

“Explain why you want to get a master's degree in business administration and how it will help you reach your career goals,” according to simplilearn. “Emphasize the precise talents you want to develop and how they relate to the field, job function, or sector you're interested in. What prompted you to pursue this degree at this time?”

“WHY THIS BUSINESS SCHOOL?”

Nearly every interview will include a “why our school” question. Experts recommend crafting your response in a way that demonstrates your fit with the B-school and its culture and offerings.

“Mention your achievements, emphasize the abilities you've developed so far in your career, and explain how your academic and professional experience will benefit others in the program,” according to simplilearn.

It can also be beneficial to highlight direct opportunities at the B-school that align with your goals.

“Tell the admissions committee or interviewer what classes and majors interest you, and why,” Stephanie Horn, an admissions consultant at Admissionado, says. “Show them you have gone beyond the school landing pages to really dig into how you can customize your classes to meet your unique needs and future goals.”

“WHAT WOULD YOUR CO-WORKERS, SUPERVISOR, OR FRIENDS SAY ABOUT YOU?”

This personality question is designed to better understand your professional and personal traits. Experts recommend utilizing points from your letter of recommendation to paint an authentic picture of who you are.

“It's most likely the person who wrote your letter of recommendation, if they say, supervisor,” according to simplilearn. “As a result, avoid making things up because any inaccuracies may create suspicion.”

TOP 15 MBA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

Tell me something about yourself

What motivates you to pursue a graduate business degree?

Why do you want to join this business school?

Why should we take you in?

Discuss your achievements as a leader

What are your strengths and weaknesses?

What aspects of your current job do you enjoy?

What are your immediate and long-term objectives?

How would an MBA help you advance in your career?

Are you a team player? Describe

What would your co-workers, supervisor, or friends say about you?

How do you make the most of your resources?

Have you applied to any other schools?

Describe a period when you had an inept manager and how you dealt with the situation

Do you have any concerns or inquiries about the school or program?

How to Write the GMAT Essay

Despite the Analytical Writing Assessment not contributing to your total GMAT score, it does play a subtle role in your admissions criteria.

“While AWA may not explicitly help your case, a low AWA score definitely acts as a deterrent, scoring less than 4 on the GMAT essay can damage your chances of admission to top business schools,” says Manan Kumar, of ENZ PREP.

Erika Väätäinen, an admissions consultant at mbaMission, recently broke down the importance of the GMAT essay and offered an organizational framework for applicants to follow.

BRAINSTORM

First and foremost, start by reading the essay prompt carefully. In many ways, the prompt will look and feel just like the Critical Reasoning arguments of the GMAT.

“The argument will most closely resemble Assumption Family arguments, so find the conclusion and make sure you understand how the author is trying to support their conclusion,” Väätäinen says. “Next, brainstorm any assumptions that you can think of and jot these down.”

After brainstorming, start articulating the flaws in the argument—pick two or three to form the basis of your essay.

“Any assumptions are automatically flaws, because the author has not established that those assumptions are, in fact, true,” Väätäinen says. “You may also think of other flaws along the way.”

FIRST PARAGRAPH

Your first paragraph should summarize the conclusion of the given argument in one to two sentences and contain your thesis.

“The thesis is typically one sentence and conveys to the reader your overall message or point for the essay that you wrote,” Väätäinen says. “For the argument essay, you can write most of your thesis sentence before you get to the test! You already know that the argument will contain flaws, and that you will be discussing how those flaws hurt the author’s conclusion. Guess what? That is always your thesis.”

BODY PARAGRAPHS

Dedicate each body paragraph to a flaw. In each paragraph, Väätäinen recommends including the following:

Introduce one flaw (Do not repeat the exact language from the prompt)

Explain why it is a flaw (JHow does this make the conclusion less likely to be true?)

Suggest ways to fix the flaw (you are fixing the flaw, not changing the conclusion; what could the author do to strengthen their argument?)

“For example, let us say that an argument claims that firing half of a company’s employees will help the company to reduce costs and therefore become more profitable,” Väätäinen says. “What is the conclusion, what supports that conclusion, and what assumptions is the author making?”

CONCLUSION PARAGRAPH

Using different words, your conclusion paragraph should restate your thesis, reacknowledge the other side, and briefly summarize how your examples support your thesis. Väätäinen recommends keeping your conclusion paragraph to three to four sentences max.

“Basically, the conclusion paragraph is not going to contain much new information,” Väätäinen says. “It is a conclusion; the major points should already have been made earlier in the essay. What you are doing now is tying everything together in one neat package.”

Late last year, investors flocked to Treasuries amid expectations of rate cuts by the Fed as early as the first quarter of this year. This surge in demand caused government bond prices to rebound sharply from 16-year lows. However, many investors are now reassessing their positions following robust U.S. jobs data and a cautious tone from the Fed, with the central bank recently warning that a strong economy could lead to inflationary pressures if rates are reduced prematurely. While investors still anticipate multiple rate cuts this year, there is now greater uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of the Fed's monetary easing measures.

That said, investors would do well to recall that the NASDAQ Composite experienced a sharp decline of over 33% in 2022 amid concerns of a recession. Even during the pandemic-induced volatility of 2020, characterized by surges in tech-heavy growth stocks, the index closed the year with an impressive gain of nearly 44%. It appears that this positive momentum is carrying into 2024, with many investors maintaining confidence in their tech holdings and anticipating further profitability as the year unfolds. The latest growth indicators suggest that the index is poised for another record-setting year in the market.

On February 1, Farzin Azarm from Mizuho Americas discussed current trends in the US tech sector and investors' continued focus on tech stocks during an appearance on CNBC. Azarm suggests that the persistent favoritism towards US tech stocks is leading to a disregard for stocks from other regions, particularly those from China. He posits that a significant shift in the US tech and AI sectors is necessary to redirect investment interest towards Chinese stocks. Azarm notes that investors, having already allocated substantial funds to pricey American stocks, are hesitant to further invest in similarly expensive companies.

Given the circumstances outlined above, it's no wonder that renowned companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remain top contenders as some of the best American stocks to invest in, both in the eyes of analysts and investors.

In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.

The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.

The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.

Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.

To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI.

Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”

10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11.

“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

Here is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 134

Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”

6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 163

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in. On January 30, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported its fourth quarter results.

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search.

The persistent rise in inflation is driving more Americans to seek additional sources of income, with nearly 8.13 million people holding multiple jobs in January. This trend represents about 5.1% of the total US workforce, and hence, highlights the financial strain caused by high inflation. Despite nominal wage growth, the average hourly earnings for all employees have declined by 2.89% since January 2021. As a result, households are grappling with a major increase in the cost of living, with expenses like food and shelter seeing high spikes. For instance, food prices have increased by 33.7% since the start of 2021, while shelter costs have risen by 18.7%. With inflation remaining well above the Federal Reserve's target, Americans are facing an ongoing struggle to manage their finances amid the economic challenges posed by increasing prices.

Owing to the rising inflation, individuals across the globe have been engaged in freelancing and thus, into remote work. In fact, the number of freelancers has been on the rise, with the US freelancing market alone valued at $1.2 trillion in 2020 with approximately 36% of the total workforce, which equates to nearly 59 million individuals.

By Zeba Siddiqui

(Reuters) -Internet giant Google on Tuesday called out a series of surveillance software companies that it said were enabling the use of dangerous hacking tools, and urged the United States and its allies to do more to rein in the spyware industry.

Spyware firms often say their products are meant for the use of governments for national security. However, the technology has been repeatedly found to have been used to hack into the phones of civil society, political opposition and journalists in the last decade. The industry has faced increasing scrutiny since the Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware was found on the phones of various people globally, including human rights defenders.

In a report on Tuesday, Google researchers said that while NSO is better known, there are dozens of smaller firms helping the proliferation of spy technology for malicious uses.

The findings by Alphabet Inc's Google are significant because the company has some of the best visibility into hacking campaigns globally, given the vast breadth of its online offerings.

""Demand from government customers remains strong and our findings underscore the extent to which commercial spyware vendors have proliferated hacking and spyware capabilities that weaken the safety of the Internet for all,"" researchers from Google's TAG threat-hunting team said in the report.

""The private sector is now responsible for a significant portion of the most sophisticated tools we detect.""

The United States and several of its allies committed last year to work toward curbing the surveillance software industry, after at least 50 U.S. government employees in 10 countries were found to have been targeted by spyware.

The Google researchers named a roster of firms that offer a range of services to break into phones, and have been evolving to bypass the latest security measures by Apple and Google for their phone operating systems iOS and Android.

They include the Italian firms Cy4Gate and RCS Labs, Greek company Intellexa, and the lesser-known Italian company Negg Group and Spain's Variston.

Negg Group’s website says the company is focused on cybersecurity, but Google said its software was found to have been used to spy on people in Italy, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan.

Variston made software that infected user’s devices via the browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or iOS apps, Google said, adding that another company, Protected AE -- also known as Protect Electronic Systems -- used a similar targeting technique.

The five companies either did not respond to requests for comment, or were not reachable.

The Google report comes a day after the United States announced a new visa restriction policy for those it said were misusing commercial spyware, allowing the placing of restrictions on individuals believed to have been involved in the abuse of commercial spyware, as well as for those who facilitate such actions and benefit from it.

""Limiting spyware vendors' ability to operate in the U.S. helps to change the incentive structure which has allowed their continued growth,"" Google said in a statement.

These companies are some of the best long-term tech stocks to invest in and have been dubbed the best tech stocks to buy for several years, all due to their stellar performance. But they have been joined by many other notable names, which our list below will highlight.

Upslope Capital Management mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”

GOOGL,2024-02-01,"By Herbert Lash and Marc Jones

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global equity markets rebounded on Thursday on expectations that interest cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks were coming, though not as soon as hoped for, while Treasury yields slid again on concerns about regional U.S. banks.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday pushed back on market speculation that rates would be cut in March, sparking a sell-off on Wall Street that lingered into Thursday until investors turned their focus to corporate earnings.

MSCI's index of equity performance in 47 countries at first seesawed but later rose as investors looked ahead to results from megacap stars Apple, Amazon.com and Meta Platforms after the bell.

A number of investors already had discounted the narrative that many rate cuts were on the horizon, said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""To most investors the important thing is the trend that rates are likely headed lower, even if it's not as quickly as some would like,"" Meckler said, adding the focus is now on earnings and whether megacap results can support their prices.

Apple's iPhone sales are expected to show the best growth in five quarters, but analysts see a tough year for the company in China. Traders are eager to see if Amazon can cash in on its delivery heft by boosting fee revenue from its ""Buy With Prime"" service.

MSCI's all-country world index closed up 0.67%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.97%, the S&P 500 added 1.25% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3%.

Futures have pared bets for a rate cut in March to 37.5% from almost 90% at year-end 2023, but increased the likelihood of a cut or two to 96% when the Fed meets in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.

The Fed's inflation fight got a boost on Thursday, with data showing U.S. worker productivity grew more quickly than expected in the fourth quarter to keep unit labor costs contained.

Labor Department data also showed job market momentum is slowly fading, which could help to curb wage inflation. Other data showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose to a two-month high last week.

The dollar fell against the euro and yen, while sterling rebounded after a Bank of England meeting that sought more evidence of slowing inflation before it would cut rates.

The dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.52%. The euro rose 0.48% to $1.0868, the yen strengthened 0.32% to 146.42 per dollar and sterling was at $1.2744, up 0.47% on the day.

Euro zone inflation eased as expected last month but underlying price pressures fell less than forecast, likely boosting the European Central Bank's argument that rate cuts should not be rushed.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.37%.

Treasuries rallied strongly, with 10-year yields slipping 10 basis points to 3.865%, amid jitters over regional U.S. banks after shares of New York Community Bancorp fell further on concerns about commercial real estate.

The KBW Regional Banking index fell 2.28%.

""If we didn't have the issue with New York Bancorp, where concerns about tight credit conditions clearly affected the profitability of that bank, then we would probably be talking about a different story for rates,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of fixed currency strategy Amundi US in Boston.

Asian markets were choppy overnight. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose 0.2%, helped by Chinese blue chips that snapped a four-day slide, along with better surveys on home prices and manufacturing.

Japan's Nikkei eased 0.8% as the yen gained.

Oil prices fell more 2% after false market speculation that Israel agreed to a Gaza ceasefire. A Qatar official told Reuters that Hamas has received a ceasefire proposal positively, but it has not yet responded to it.

Brent crude futures plummeted $1.85 to settle at $78.70 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $2.03 to settle at $73.82.

Gold firmed nearer a one-month high after data showed U.S. weekly jobless claims rose last week.

U.S. gold futures settled 0.2% higher at $2071.10 an ounce.

GOOGL,2024-01-31,"In this article, we take a look at here is how billionaire Chris Hohn's hedge fund beat the market with 33% gain and his top 9 stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion of Hohn's investment philosophy, his fund's performance and go directly to Here is How Billionaire Chris Hohn's Hedge Fund Beat the Market with 33% Gain and His Top 5 Stock Picks.

Founded in 2003 by billionaire investor Chris Hohn, the TCI Fund Management was up 32.7% in 2023, recouping a significant chunk of the losses accrued in 2022. The hedge fund was down by about 18% in 2022 as the S&P 500 fell 19% at the height of a ferocious market sell-off triggered by a significant spike in inflation and a push by the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates.

TCI Fund Management had one of the best years in 2019 as it returned $8.4 billion worth of net gains, providing a 41% return against an average hedge fund return of 10.35%. It returned 14% at the height of the COVID 19 pandemic in 2020. Likewise, it outperformed the overall sector as equity hedge funds gained 6.65% on average in 2023 against its 32.7%, benefiting from solid gains in the technology sector.

Hohn founded the hedge fund with his ex-wife, Jamie Cooper Hohn, with the sole aim of transforming the lives of children and adolescents. Consequently, the hedge fund manager donates 50 basis points of the management fees to the fund to help fund various charitable initiatives. In addition, the fund also finances various causes, including climate, sexual & reproductive health, aimed at improving the health and lives of girls all over the world.

TCI Fund Management has been growing in strength since it bounced back from a 43% drawdown amid the global financial crisis in 2008. It has generated, on average, 18% in annualized gain since inception, more than double the return of the S&P 500 index over the same period. The gains have come on Hohn running mostly long only and a very concentrated global portfolio of stocks.

TCI Fund Management 's performance in 2023 affirmed Hohn's stock-picking skills that have always allowed him to outperform the overall market. The hedge fund has posted profits for 13 straight years through 2021. It only lost money when it went down by 18% in 2022 as its investments in Alphabet and Microsoft turned sour amid a broader sell-off in the tech sectors.

In 2023, it was a different ball game as TCI Fund Management benefited from its exposure to high-growth stocks that exploded at the height of the bull run. Its biggest holdings were all up by more than 25% for the year, helping propel TCI Fund Management to stellar gains in 2023.

The hedge fund also benefited from the diversification strategy that Hohn has always relied on to generate returns in the market. Over the years, Hohn has always emphasized investing in various industries, including manufacturers, consumer products companies, and even banks. While the services sector accounts for the biggest share of TCI Fund Management holdings, the fund is also heavily invested in technology and health care.

Chris Hohn

Hohn is also known for his relentless efforts in pushing companies to make strategic changes to improve performance and returns. He occasionally spearheads activist campaigns whenever he believes a stock is trading below its intrinsic value. One of his most recent activist campaigns was at Alphabet, where he penned a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai asking the executive to initiate structural changes in the push to cut back on expenses and reduce headcount.

It is still unclear whether Hohn’s activist campaign letter prompted Alphabet to embark on a restructuring drive. Concerned by soaring pressure amid artificial intelligence threats mostly spearheaded by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) took drastic changes that involved laying thousands of workers.

The tech giant also bolstered its investments in artificial intelligence, resulting in the launch of AI-powered chatbot Bard. Amid the efforts, Hohn also pushed Alphabet to consider decreasing salaries as one of the ways of clamping down on expenses as competition for talent in the industry has subsidized significantly.

Airbus is another company that has felt the full brunt of Hohn activists' campaigns. In February of last year, the billionaire investor wrote a letter urging the company to terminate ongoing negotiations over the purchase of a minority stake in Evidian.

With about $4.3 billion worth of stakes in Airbus, the billionaire reiterated the investment would only be value-destructive. While Airbus shrugged off the activist campaign and went ahead with the deal, it ultimately fell apart amid regulatory hurdles.

GOOGL,2024-01-31,"""What I learned at business school was that Silicon Valley was the center of the creation of the internet industry… It seemed crazy to go back to New York."" Kacher once told Forbes.

The Silicon Valley insights help guide Kacher’s long and short investment strategies. For example, he takes long positions in industry disruptors and shorts the incumbents. After learning that business travelers preferred ride-hailing services like Uber to traditional rental car services, Kacher went about shorting rental car stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) and made good money out of it.

Also, Kacher shorts auto parts stocks because he believes that the rise of ride-sharing and electric cars will reduce consumer demand for auto parts.

As with all other hedge funds, Kacher’s Light Street Capital has had its hits and misses. There are years that it has delivered outstanding returns and years when it has suffered overwhelming losses.

From 2010 through 2017, Light Street’s annualized net returns stood at 19.8%. In 2017, the fund delivered returns of 38.6%. In 2018, its returns improved to 53% in the first 10 months of the year.

But 2021 and 2022 turned out to be punishing years for Kacher. His hedge fund lost 26% in 2021 and things only got worse in 2022 when the fund lost 54%. In 2022, soaring inflation, Russia’s war with Ukraine and rising interest rates combined to hurt technology companies. That dealt a heavy blow to tech-focused hedge funds such as Light Street Capital.

Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital

But the fund made a strong comeback in 2023, returning 46%. In 2023, tech stocks benefited from AI excitement, which led to the blockbuster returns at Light Street Capital.

The AI theme is expected to continue impacting tech stocks in 2024. In a recent interview with CNBC, Glen Kacher spoke about AI being a multi-decade opportunity.

While there will no doubt be ups and downs, the hedge fund boss noted that AI presents a huge tailwind and opportunity for investors. He sees the AI impact on technology companies being as massive as the previous major technology shifts, such as the shift from PCs to networks or SaaS software.

Kacher believes that AI presents a massive opportunity for the leaders in the technology sector and that AI is an incredible opportunity for investors to deploy their capital behind.

As to the best way for investors to get exposure to AI opportunities, Kacher believes that semiconductor stocks present a good opportunity. He notes that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the chip companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI.

Software companies are also great opportunities, according to Kacher. The hedge fund boss said that Magnificent Seven companies are best-positioned to ride the AI trend. He noted that these are companies with customers, massive data and massive amounts of capital.

AI is going to be a big deal for the tech industry in 2024. In Davos, industry experts spoke about 2024 being a potentially big year for AI. They noted that 2023 was the year of discovery when AI proved its ability and that 2024 will be the year when focus will be on improving the technology’s reliability so that those adopting it can be more comfortable with it.

Apart from AI continuing to attract more money to the technology stocks, the economic outlook also looks promising for tech companies. The Fed appears to have succeeded in cooling off inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Technology companies tend to thrive in an environment of low interest rates as borrowing becomes cheap and obtaining capital becomes easy.

Amid the continuing AI excitement and growing optimism over economic outlook as inflation cools and the Fed contemplates rate cuts, stocks are soaring in 2024 with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in January.

In its latest 13F filing, Light Street Capital revealed large stakes in semiconductor stocks that are expected to benefit from AI-fueled demand. The filing also shows that the fund remains heavily invested in software companies that develop AI tools or stand to benefit from integrating AI systems into their operations.

With these details in mind, let’s take a look at the top 15 stocks in Glen Kacher’s Light Street Capital portfolio.

Our Methodology

Light Street Capital bounced back in 2023 after the rout of technology companies in 2022 wiped out some 70% of the firm’s assets. The hedge fund benefited from its long positions in some extensive tech stocks that exploded amid the artificial intelligence frenzy.

“Indie Semiconductor, Inc. is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of automotive semiconductors for advanced driver assistance systems and connected-car user experience and electrification applications. Shares fell during the quarter due to investor concerns that near-term automotive semiconductor demand will face headwinds because of excess inventory in the automotive semiconductor supply chain, combined with third quarter revenue guidance that slightly missed consensus expectations due to a customer slightly delaying the launch of a new vehicle model where indie had secured a design win (so delayed, not lost sales). As indie steadily ramps new product and design wins into production, we are confident the company will achieve its targeted model of profitability by year end, while effectively doubling revenues as it delivers on its $4.3 billion and growing strategic backlog. We believe indie has the potential to grow from its $200 million revenue run rate today to its targeted $500 million by 2025 and $1 billion by 2028. In the years ahead, indie should benefit as it develops differentiated, highly integrated, energy-efficient products, while the automotive semiconductor vertical remains highly attractive over the long term.”

Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”

Here is what Greenhaven Road Capital said about Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)– Cellebrite provides tools to law enforcement to extract data (evidence) from cell phones, analyze the data, and manage the data. Solving many crimes without their tools is inconceivable. They are mission critical. One of the best indicators of business quality is pricing power. The ability to raise price only comes with attributes such as high switching costs and a limited competitive landscape. Cellebrite benefits from both, but has not aggressively flexed their pricing power to date. After being acquired by private equity, the company’s competitor, Grayshift, has reportedly been raising prices by more than 30% on select products. Cellebrite is taking more of a velvet glove approach, offering newer products with more functionality at higher prices, e.g., their “Premium” offering, which offers additional features and is, in fact, “premium” but is also 40-50% more expensive. The combination of raising prices, introducing new products, and cross-selling analytics products should fuel growth for the next several years. Extracting data from devices and making sense of it is not going to get easier nor is it going to become less mission-critical. Law enforcement needs tools to fight crime, and Cellebrite is the leading “arms dealer” to collect and review data from mobile phones.

9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Light Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.79 Million

Number of Hedge fund Holders: 81

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a pioneer electric vehicle company that designs, develops, manufactures and sells zero emission motor vehicles, energy generation and storage systems. . Tesla, Inc.

Tsai Capital Corporation, an investment management firm, mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:

“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”

However, the company’s Cloud division, which is expected to generate growth from selling access to artificial intelligence services, saw its growth rate slow modestly. Juxtaposed with Microsoft’s Cloud business seeing growth pick up slightly, investors sold off Google’s stock on the report. While the stock recovered to new highs by the end of the year, the earnings report set back caused the stock to trail behind the S&P 500 with a gain of 6.8% for the quarter.”

GOOGL,2024-01-31,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at theHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.

Charles Paquelet is an American hedge fund manager who founded Skylands Capital in 2004. Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:

''Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,"" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.

In 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital. The fund had $661 million under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. You will see some of the top names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the fund's portfolio as well as spot under-the-radar small-cap names which could explode in the future.

Charles Paquelet's Investment Philosophy

Skylands Capital's investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to ""extrapolate"" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who ""can anticipate change before it is obvious.""

Value or Growth?

Charles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.

""It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important,"" the fund's website says.

Methodology

“Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a leading mobile voice and data communications services vendor offering global coverage via satellite. Shares fell on second quarter earnings, growth modestly slower than expected. Investors were also concerned by a potential slowdown in Iridium’s voice and data segment following several years during which the segment benefited from price increases and competition displacements. We attribute the earnings miss to a one-time write off of a spare satellite. This will not impact the company’s long-term prospects. We also remain excited about the potential benefit from Iridium’s recent partnership with Qualcomm to allow satellite connectivity on its new Snapdragon chips. While Iridium has suggested the realization of the direct-to-device opportunity might take longer than some investors had hoped, we believe the collaboration will yield substantial revenue for the company over time. We also remain excited about the company’s capital allocation program, which should benefit shareholders in the years ahead.”

GOOGL,2024-01-30,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company’s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.

The Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what’s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.

Looking Beyond Encouraging Demand Trends

The Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.

According to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled – a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.

There is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.

Apple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.

The AR/VR Market Has Room for Disruption

Empirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple’s success stems from the company’s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.

Today, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.

The relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.

Apple’s Scale Problem

Apple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.

The problem with Apple’s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.

Even if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple’s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.

The highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company’s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.

Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?

Apple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple’s prospects, but they’re currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here’s what some analysts have said about Apple.

On January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock’s price target from $208 to $225, citing the company’s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.

On January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank’s best investment ideas.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.

Last week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.

Overall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.

The Takeaway: Vision Pro is Exciting, Apple’s Valuation Is Not

Apple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple’s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.

GOOGL,2024-01-26,"Amazon.Com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced a significant expansion in Mississippi with a $10 billion investment by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to build two data center complexes, the most essential capital investment in the state’s history.

In collaboration with the Madison County Economic Development Authority, this project aims to create at least 1,000 new jobs and boost Mississippi’s tech sector and GDP.

Roger Wehner, AWS’s economic development director, highlighted the investment’s potential to generate well-paying jobs and new regional opportunities.

Recently, Amazon named John Felton as the new AWS CFO, succeeding Richard Puccio, to supervise Amazon’s cloud unit.

Amazon’s commitment to Mississippi extends beyond this project, with investments totaling $2.3 billion since 2010.

These include infrastructure projects, renewable energy initiatives like the state’s first utility-scale wind farm in Tunica County, and a Whole Foods Market location.

The wind farm alone will likely create nearly 300 jobs during peak construction and provide significant tax revenue.

Overall, Amazon’s presence in Mississippi has created 7,500 direct jobs and supports an additional 9,000 indirect jobs while aiding over 1,000 independent sellers in the state.

The company’s efforts focus on helping local jobs, economic growth, and education and enabling opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses.

Earlier this month, AWS shared plans to invest close to 2.3 trillion yen ($15.5 billion) in Japan between 2023 and 2027 to foster data centers and bolster business operations.

The investment in Japan will exceed the ₹1.056 trillion ($12.7 billion) AWS earmarked for India.

In the second quarter of 2023, Amazon held a dominant share of 32% compared to Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Azure’s 22%, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud’s 11%.

Price Action: AMZN shares are up 0.54% at $158.60 premarket on the last check Friday.

GOOGL,2024-01-26,"Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is implementing layoffs of close to 700 employees, about 1% of its 70,000-strong workforce, following a previous reduction of 10% or around 8,000 workers in 2023.

This move comes amid ongoing cost-cutting pressures from investors, including activist shareholders like Elliott Management, to drive its margins.

Despite these cuts, Salesforce still maintains 1,000 open positions, suggesting these layoffs are part of workforce adjustments rather than a significant strategic shift, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The company’s focus is on directing spending towards growth.

Last September, Salesforce also shared plans to hire nearly 3,300 new employees across various departments, focusing significantly on sales, engineering, and developing the company’s data cloud product.

These steps have contributed to a significant boost in its stock value, which increased by almost 80% over the last 12 months, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 37% rise.

Tech firms increasingly focus on artificial intelligence (AI), leading to a hiring surge in this area while other sectors face layoffs into 2024. Over 20,000 tech workers have been laid off so far in 2024, as reported by layoffs.

In January 2023, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google divulged plans to eliminate 12,000 positions, comprising 6% of its global employees.

According to Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, while companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google heavily invest in AI, they are cutting back in non-strategic areas, CNBC reports.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has informed employees of more impending job cuts as the company shifts its investments towards AI.

Alex Kantrowitz of Big Technology notes that in the current economic climate, Big Tech companies need to find cost-cutting measures to invest in the expensive AI sector, a trend other major tech firms are likely to follow.

In 2023, the tech sector let go of 141,516 employees in the first half of the year compared with about 6,000 a year ago.

German software company SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) announced the restructuring of about 8,000 roles to focus more on AI.",0.0184540719696969,0.4509232954545454,Neutral,0.99241441488266,0.4523933677690329
GOOGL,2024-01-25,"Google parent Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is up on Thursday. It resolved a patent lawsuit on Wednesday involving AI technology, with the claim amounting to an extraordinary $1.67 billion.

Singular Computing, established by Massachusetts computer scientist Joseph Bates, initiated the lawsuit. The company accused Google of misusing its computer-processing solutions.

Google has also partnered with Hugging Face, a startup specializing in AI software, to host its platform on Google’s cloud computing network.

This collaboration will allow Hugging Face to offer its platform through Google Cloud, significantly expanding developers’ access to the startup’s AI tools.

The Hugging Face partnership will likely accelerate innovation by enabling more developers to create AI applications using Hugging Face’s resources and Google Cloud’s computing capabilities and specialized hardware, Bloomberg reports.

This agreement bolsters Google’s relationship with the open-source AI community, a sector increasingly competitive with significant tech companies in developing cost-effective AI models.

Hugging Face, a New York-based company founded in 2016, has gained popularity for sharing open-source AI models.

Through this partnership, developers using Hugging Face will benefit from the technological resources of Google Cloud.

Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue highlighted the partnership’s potential to enhance the capabilities of both Hugging Face users and Google Cloud customers.

Google’s involvement in Hugging Face’s recent funding round, valued at $4.5 billion, further solidifies its collaborative efforts in the AI field.

In 2023, Google committed close to $2 billion to AI startup Anthropic after reports of Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) decided to earmark $4 billion.

Google already integrated its Bard artificial intelligence chatbot with several popular products, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs.

Big tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google, remain aggressively invested in their AI ambitions. Analysts projected $1 trillion in AI-driven opportunities for companies like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) as they wholeheartedly splurge on AI technology.

GOOGL,2024-01-24,"The Magnificent Seven tech stocks, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), are again driving the stock market’s surge.

These tech giants, known for their stellar performance last year, have returned 4.4% this month, outperforming the S&P 500.

Investors are flocking to tech stocks, with approximately $4 billion poured into tech funds in the past two weeks, marking the most significant inflow since August, the Wall Street Journal reports.

In 2023, these seven stocks collectively doubled in value, adding a staggering $5.1 trillion to their market capitalization.

Among these tech giants, Nvidia is a critical player in the ongoing tech-driven rally.

The company’s success is closely linked to the surging demand for semiconductor chips, especially those used to power artificial intelligence (AI) programs.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), a significant supplier for semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, recently announced its expected 20% revenue growth for the year.

Analysts remained bullish on Nvidia, citing improving PCs, AI deep learning, and inferencing markets now with generative AI tailwinds, gaming trends, automotive, and data centers.

The Big Tech stocks remain invested in ramping up their AI capabilities. Analysts have voiced $1 trillion in AI-driven opportunity for Nvidia being the frontrunner in GPU and chip supply.

This growing demand is a critical factor in the resurgence of these tech stocks and the broader stock market.

While the Magnificent Seven tech stocks have been performing well, it’s important to note that their returns this year, although impressive, have not reached the levels seen in the previous January.

Despite the slightly more modest outlook, Wall Street analysts recommend these stocks, projecting an average return of 8.6% for the group over the next 12 months.

GOOGL,2024-01-22,"Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is under fire from employees past and present who think that the company's leadership lacks vision.

What Happened: Diane Hirsh Theriault, a software engineer at Google, criticized the tech giant’s leadership on LinkedIn earlier last week. Theriault asserted that the company lacks visionary leaders and has been conducting random layoffs for the past six to 12 months.

Theriault described Google’s leaders as “profoundly boring and glassy-eyed,” stating that the company hasn’t launched a successful executive-driven initiative in years.

The employee also criticized Google’s approach to product development, comparing it to the BogoSort algorithm, where elements are reordered randomly until they land in order.

According to the post, Google’s executives are trying to steer the company towards artificial intelligence (AI), but without a clear vision.

Meanwhile, layoffs continue across various departments, including engineering, sales, support, UX, product, data science, and SRE.

See Also: Ex-Googler Calls Out CEO Sundar Pichai’s ‘Lack Of Visionary Leadership,’ Says Company Morale At ‘An All-Time Low’

The employee also highlighted a growing sense of nihilism among the staff, with many choosing to just do their jobs until they are let go. The post ended with a lament for the loss of Google’s once magical work environment and the fear-driven atmosphere that has replaced it.

According to Equity Research Analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Justin Patterson, Google CEO Sundar Pichai's quest for ""durable cost savings"" might have harmed the company.

""While we expect layoffs will be more modest than 2022’s, we do believe Alphabet may have unintentionally harmed productivity by creating uncertainty over which roles will be affected,"" Patterson noted.

Why It Matters: This isn’t the first time Google’s leadership has been called into question. In November, former Google employee Ian “Hixie” Hickinson criticized Pichai for displaying a ""lack of visionary leadership"" and disinterest in maintaining the ethos of Google that made it a successful company.

He also stated that the employee morale at Google is at an all-time low and that therapists in the Bay Area would say that all Googlers are “unhappy” with the company.

GOOGL,2024-01-16,"Insider Ownership Of Oscar Health

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

We can report that insiders do own shares in Oscar Health, Inc.. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own US$66m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.

General Public Ownership

With a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Oscar Health. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 22%, private equity firms could influence the Oscar Health board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.

Public Company Ownership

Public companies currently own 6.2% of Oscar Health stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Oscar Health , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Cloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.

The growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.

Currently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.

Even with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.

The Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.

GOOGL,2024-06-25,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) is significantly expanding its operations in response to growing demand in the AI, 5G, server, and data center markets.

The company remains engaged in its geographical expansion while maintaining Taiwan as its base.

Acter Group Co, a semiconductor equipment and chemicals supplier, is accelerating its overseas expansion, primarily focusing on Japan and Southeast Asia to support these demands.

The expansion is a strategic response to geopolitical risks and the need for diversified manufacturing sites, Taipei Times reports.

Acter Group Co-President Wang Chun-sheng emphasized the company’s strategy to enhance its global footprint.

Acter’s significant clients include TSMC, United Microelectronics Co (NYSE:UMC), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia Corp, and Alphabet Inc’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

In addition to Asia, Acter is considering expansion projects in Mexico and the US, aiming to follow their clients’ geographical diversification.

Acter prioritizes Southeast Asia, Japan, and India for overseas expansion.

Last month, Acter’s subsidiary, Rayzher Industrial Co, established a branch in Kumamoto, Japan, to support TSMC’s fab operations.

Rayzher is also planning a second overseas site in Germany, where TSMC will likely build a new 12-inch fab through a joint venture.

Taiwan Semiconductor gained 68% in the last 12 months.

TSMC Stock Prediction For 2024

Equity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.

Some investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Taiwan Semiconductor, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Taiwan Semiconductor, the 200-day moving average sits at $120.13, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $170.84. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.

Traders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.

Price Action: TSM shares traded higher by 1.51% to $170.35 at the last check on Tuesday.

GOOGL,2024-06-21,"We recently published a list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.

UBS Global Wealth Management’s (GWM) recently published a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI “value chain,” estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.

UBS segments the AI market into three layers – Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem — infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments, Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.

Next up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.

The third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it’s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers — think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.

Key AI Predictions

The UBS report also made key “predictions” about the AI landscape. The firm’s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a “capex cycle” that could “inflate” the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects “monolithic players” and “AI foundries” prevailing in the near future.

Based on this report, let’s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 165

According to the latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain – enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.

Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”

Overall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

They’re known as the “FAANG” stocks. Keep reading for a more thorough explanation of these stocks and a look at how much you would have made had you invested $5,000 in them a decade ago.

Wealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.

FAANG: Stocks With Real Bite

When people talk about the FAANG stocks, they’re referring to five of the most prominent and traditionally high-performing tech and social media companies. Here’s what the acronym originally stood for, though now it’s a little outdated.

Facebook, now called Meta Platforms, with the ticker symbol META.

Apple, with the ticker symbol AAPL, which hasn’t changed since the company’s December 12, 1980, initial public offering.

Amazon, another globally recognized brand, with the ticker symbol AMZN.

Netflix, which still sports its original ticker symbol, NFLX.

Google, whose parent company is now Alphabet Inc., though it’s retained the ticker symbol GOOG.

Together, the FAANG stocks are often referenced for their consistently strong market performance, ongoing efforts to innovate and huge market capitalizations.

A Decade of Technological Development

In terms of how far and fast technology has developed, 2014 seems like a lot more than 10 years ago. The tech sector was still seen as one of the largest opportunities for growth and formed the backbone of many forward-thinking financial strategies. But even the most astute analysts would have been hard-pressed to predict how big these tech companies would become and the financial performance that has made them the titans they are today.

Historical FAANG Prices Compared With Where They Are Today

Here are the prices of each of the five FAANG stocks from 10 years ago and today.

If you had invested $5,000 equally in these five companies, for an investment of $1,000 each, those $1,000 investments would look something like the following.",0.1902131782945736,0.4167958656330749,Neutral,0.9998786449432372,0.4417033744022204
GOOGL,2024-06-14,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified briefly Friday at the federal financial conspiracy trial surrounding buzz-to-bust startup Ozy Media, countering founder Carlos Watson's alleged claims that the search giant once sought to buy Ozy.

Google did consider hiring Watson for a high-level news executive job in 2021 and putting $25 million into Ozy in something of a tradeoff for luring him away, Pichai told jurors.

“Mr. Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,"" he explained.

But “did you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?” prosecutor Dylan Stern asked.

“No,” replied Pichai, who heads Google and parent Alphabet Inc.

He said he had been introduced to Watson at a conference and then in a video interview for a possible Google job interacting with news outlets. Neither the hire nor the $25 million investment ultimately happened.

According to prosecutors, Watson later told another prospective investor that Pichai himself had extended a nine-figure offer to buy Ozy. The Mountain View, California-based company produced TV programs, podcasts and a music-and-ideas festival before falling apart in fall 2021 amid questions about whether it had flagrantly misrepresented its audience reach, deals and finances.

Ozy Media lawyer Shannon Frison said in an emailed statement Friday that it's “unequivocally untrue"" that Watson told anyone that Google had made a $600 million offer.

“He never had such a conversation with Google and never told any person that he did,” Frison said.

Watson and Ozy Media have pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit fraud. He has said that he built a robust and real company, didn't con anyone and is being singled out for prosecution when he made, at most, entrepreneurial “mistakes.”

Defense lawyers have blamed any misrepresentations on Ozy co-founder Samir Rao, saying he is falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison himself. Rao pleaded guilty to identity theft and conspiring to commit fraud, and he is awaiting sentencing.

He testified earlier in the trial that his “moral compass” got scrambled by ambition, desperation to keep the company going and “Carlos’ deep belief that failure was not an option and we had to do whatever it took.”

Among other deceit, Rao infamously posed as a YouTube executive — even using a phone app to disguise his voice — in order to champion Ozy to Goldman Sachs investment bankers on a February 2021 call.

“It was one of the most disturbing calls that I have ever been on in my career,” Goldman executive Hillel Moerman testified Friday, calling the episode “a surreal experience.”",-0.0322463768115942,0.5764492753623189,Neutral,0.9977400302886964,0.4661490249235622

The previously proprietary platform will now be available under an Apache 2.0 license, allowing other companies to utilize and modify the underlying architecture and code without incurring costs.

The Unity Catalog will also include an OpenAPI specification, server, and clients, allowing enterprises to access and manage their data and AI assets without vendor lock-in.

This significant move by Databricks enables organizations to use the Unity Catalog with their preferred tools, including a vast ecosystem of Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg-compatible query engines, VentureBeat reports.

This comes shortly after Databricks’ competitor, Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW), introduced its open catalog implementation, Polaris Catalog, which will be open-sourced over the next 90 days. Snowflake stock is trading lower on Thursday.

The Unity Catalog’s open APIs ensure compatibility with major cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP, and Salesforce and compute engines such as Apache Spark, Presto, Trino, and others.

Snowflake is battling scrutiny after data violations affecting major clients like Santander Bank and Ticketmaster.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cybersecurity subsidiary Mandiant identified a threat campaign aimed at Snowflake customer database instances to steal data and extort victims.

GOOGL,2024-06-13,"We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 8th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Billionaire Israel Englander is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund’s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg’s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium’s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander’s imposition of “tight guardrails” to limit losses. To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.

The report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is “not a good idea.”

The FT report said Englander’s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022, 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.

For this article, we scanned Millennium Management’s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund’s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is apparently in a no-holds-barred fight against competitors in the AI race that according to many threatened the bread and butter of Google its search business. However, many analysts believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is making a big turn and will continue to grow. Alex Kantrowitz, Big Technology founder, while talking to CNBC last month, said that the present for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is looking “real good” amid revenue growth, leadership’s harsh stance against those “making trouble” insider the company, dividends and buybacks.

Latest data analyzed by Bank of America shows that across all devices, Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) market search in search actually gained half a percentage point in May on a MoM basis. BofA analyst Justin Post said this shows Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Overviews are “aiding query growth and usage.”

Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating the company’s growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet’s 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.

Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”

Overall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey’s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visit Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024 to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

GOOGL,2024-06-12,"On Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) posted its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were below estimates. But, known for its database software, Oracle went all in to expand its cloud infrastructure unit to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights

For the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG’s estimate of $14.55 billion. Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle’s cloud unit is growing faster. The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion.

Adjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG’s estimate of $1.65. Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share.

Partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum

The aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to extend Azure Al to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl. Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google’s cloud infrastructure. As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges. Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle’s cloud database growth.

Outlook Shaped By The AI Hype

For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%.

Oracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024.

For the current fiscal year ending in May 2025, Catz expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads, adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand.

Shifting focus away from weak Q4 financials.

Meanwhile, Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st. Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won’t last forever.

GOOGL,2024-06-10,"GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) shares were trading higher in the premarket in a volatile Monday session, indicating a possible rebound.

Last Friday, the stock closed lower by 39% after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings ahead of its schedule and Roaring Kitty held a live stream.

While many were looking for an updated thesis on why Gill is investing heavily in GameStop once again, several investors were left with more questions after the stream.

The livestream ended up being disappointing for investors and the stock.

The video game retailer reported net sales of $881.8 million, down from $1.237 billion last year, lagging the analyst consensus estimate of $995.3 million.

GameStop reported an EPS loss of $(0.12), missing the analyst consensus estimate loss of $(0.09).

The quarterly net loss improved to $(32.3) million, down from $(50.5) million last year. GameStop also disclosed an at-the-market offering program, which permitted the sale of up to 75 million shares.

This added to the 45 million shares sold last month, which raised $933 million.

Last week, Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty, expressed his backing for CEO Ryan Cohen during an Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube livestream, the Financial Times reports.

The retailer’s core business has been declining, with store numbers shrinking by over a quarter in five years, but investment gains have mitigated some losses.

Gill confirmed his significant investment in GameStop and denied working with any third-party funder.

Investors can gain exposure to the GameStop stock via iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJH) and SPDR MidCap Trust Series I (NYSE:MDY).

Price Action: GME shares traded lower by 3.05% at $27.36 at the last check Monday.

GOOGL,2024-06-03,"By Ira Dugal and Aftab Ahmed

DHOLERA, India /NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans a raft of business-friendly measures if he wins a third term this week, including pushing through regulations making it easier to hire and fire workers, according to two government officials familiar with the matter.

As part of an election pledge to transform India into a global manufacturing hub, Modi wants to offer subsidies for domestic production modelled on recent packages for semiconductor firms and electric vehicle makers, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to media.

The premier also plans to reduce import taxes on key inputs for locally-made goods, which have pushed up India's manufacturing costs, the officials said.

Modi's office and the labour and finance ministries did not respond to Reuters' questions.

Exit polls project that the right-wing coalition led by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will win a big majority when election results are announced on June 4.

Modi's reelection campaign was partly built on the promise of continued economic development. He's pitching India as an alternative for global firms diversifying their supply chains from China.

India is the world's fastest-growing major economy. But that includes both a booming tech sector and a struggling older economy that doesn't provide enough jobs for everyone else, said Josh Felman, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's office in India.

""What can be done now to provide employment - good jobs for these people - is manufacturing,"" Felman said.

India successfully lured suppliers for major U.S. corporations like Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. But less than 3% of global manufacturing takes place in the world's most populous country, compared to 24% for China, World Bank data shows.

The government plans to increase India's share of global manufacturing to 5% by 2030 and 10% by 2047, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. It did not provide specifics.

Reuters spoke to 15 people - including bureaucrats, representatives of major investors, economists and trade unionists - who identified three significant obstacles holding India back from manufacturing hub status: restrictive labour laws, challenges acquiring land, and a rigidly inefficient tariff regime.

When Modi was chief minister of his home state of Gujarat between 2001 and 2014, he dreamt up an investment zone in the Dholera region. Legislation creating the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR) was passed in 2009 and local authorities began acquiring land for it in 2013.

The plan, Modi said during a 2011 visit to a Chinese port, was to develop DSIR along the ""Shanghai model"".

Starting in the 1980s, China set up special economic zones along its southeastern coast that are widely credited for it becoming the world's factory floor.

Land reform was a precursor for China's manufacturing rise. Starting in the 1970s, Beijing separated ownership from usage rights, making it easier for investors to acquire industrial land, said Henry Gao, a Chinese trade expert at Singapore Management University (SMU).

Beijing's industrial zoning policies also made it easier for industries to set up in areas with ready access to materials and facilities, he said.

As prime minister, Modi has continued to stress the importance of industrial zones for India. In March, he described facilities under construction in DSIR as central to the creation of an Indian semi-conductor manufacturing hub.

Tata Group announced plans in January to build India's first semi-conductor fabrication plant there. During a visit in March, Reuters also saw construction activity for an upcoming cargo airport and promotional billboards set up by real-estate developers.

There were paved roads and a waterfront but little sign of bustling business.

DSIR hopes to attract more manufacturing companies by providing leases of up to 99 years on government-owned land, said Rahul Gupta, head of the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation.

Local officials have said that it took more than a decade to acquire land and award infrastructure contracts, but Gupta predicted there would be much more activity in about two to three years.

Outside such zones, industrial groups still have to undergo a ""very difficult process"" to acquire the large plots of land they need because title deeds are often unclear and holdings are fractured, said Richard Rossow of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.

In May, Foxconn - whose local investment was trumpeted as a major success by Modi - was met with protests by farmers in Karnataka state unhappy with the compensation they received from local authorities for giving up their land to the manufacturer, Indian media reported.

The Taiwanese company didn't return a request for comment.

LABOUR STRUGGLES

In much of India, firms with more than 100 employees need authorisation from state governments to hire and fire.

This prevents companies from adjusting their operations to meet demand, said Atul Gupta, partner at Bengalore law firm Trilegal.

The BJP-controlled parliament has passed legislation to raise the threshold before official approval to 300, but state authorities that must consent to the changes have stalled the move.

Modi hopes that a strong win on June 4th will give him the momentum and political capital to push through their opposition, the two government officials said.

""No government wants to come across as giving permission to a company to let go of their employees (but)...this is just used to drag out the closure or the terminations endlessly,"" said Gupta, who advocates labour reforms.

General Motors, for instance, decided to shut plants in Gujarat and neighboring Maharastra in 2017, citing low sales. But unions opposed the closures and GM only received judicial approval to exit India completely in January. The U.S. carmaker declined to comment.

To avoid such difficulties, companies end up using contract workers for extended periods, said labour lawyer Amrish Patel.

HSBC economists said that sweeping changes to labour regulations as well as land reforms are needed to sustain high growth.

In a note to investors last month, HSBC economist Pranjul Bhandari wrote that such reforms could allow India to grow at 7.5-8% over the next decade, creating a wealth of jobs.

But lawyer and union leader Sanjay Singhvi said nearly 60% of the workers who benefit from current labour laws would lose protections if the BJP's codes are implemented.

Praveen Chakravarty, a senior economics policy official with the main opposition Congress, told Reuters that labour law decisions should be left to the states. His party's manifesto calls for a review of the labour codes passed by parliament.

TARIFF LAND

Manufacturing costs in India are also elevated because of tariffs on imports, including components for high-end manufacturing.

To encourage smartphone production, Delhi cut import duties on components to 10%. But competitor Vietnam already levies a rate of between 0% and 5% on equivalent inputs, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association.

The average import tariff imposed by India on World Trade Organisation (WTO) members was 18.1%, compared to 7.5% for China, according to WTO data for 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available.

Customs processes are also significantly quicker and less burdensome in China, said Gao.

Imports can clear customs in China in about 20 hours, said the SMU professor. It takes between 44 and 85 hours in India, according to a 2023 government study.

Beijing has focused its efforts on being a key node in the supply chain rather than attempting to own the entire chain, leading to greater efficiencies.

For instance, products exported by China often include inputs from other Northeast Asian countries, said Christian de Guzman of Moody’s Ratings.

But Delhi ""wants to have the entire thing come onshore,"" Guzman said.

GOOGL,2024-06-02,"Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is concerned about some of OpenAI’s business dealings, particularly a potential agreement between OpenAI and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Satya Nadella recently met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to discuss this deal involving integrating OpenAI services into Apple products.

Nadella’s concerns stem from the potential impact on Microsoft’s product ambitions, the Business Insider reports.

Apple’s deal with OpenAI will solidify Altman’s control over the company after his brief ouster last fall.

Altman, who has pushed out rivals from the board, aims to replace Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as Apple’s search partner for Safari and build AI chip factories.

However, Microsoft, a significant investor in OpenAI, is concerned about the impact of the Apple deal on its own AI ambitions, according to the New York Post.

Apple considered both Google and OpenAI for this multi-billion-dollar deal.

If confirmed, this agreement would be a significant win for Altman, who has faced scrutiny from former employees and board members.

Tensions within OpenAI have reportedly been brewing since Altman’s brief ouster in November. An insider revealed to The Financial Times that Microsoft pressured OpenAI to prioritize commercial products, exacerbating existing tensions between executives.

Despite these challenges, OpenAI’s valuation has soared to $90 billion since launching ChatGPT.

Altman is considering converting OpenAI into a for-profit corporation to attract significant capital and expand its AI infrastructure.

OpenAI’s annual revenue crossed the $2 billion mark. The ChatGPT parent eyes doubling revenue by 2025.

Microsoft stock gained over 26% in the last 12 months. Apple gained 8%.

Price Actions: MSFT shares traded higher by 0.06% at $414.93 premarket at the last check Friday. AAPL is down 0.14% at $191.03.

GOOGL,2024-05-30,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Google plans to invest $2 billion in Malaysia, developing its first data center and a Google Cloud hub in the latest big foray by a U.S. tech giant in the Southeast Asian country.

The news follows Microsoft's recent announcement that it would put $2.2 billion over the next four years into building Malaysia’s new cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hailed Google’s investment as a sign of faith in Malaysia’s governance and economy. Anwar said Thursday that the investment is expected to add $3.2 billion to the economy and create 26,500 jobs by 2030.

The investments are a coup for Anwar as he seeks to consolidate his strength against a strong Islamic opposition.

Google said in a statement that the new hubs will be developed at a business park in central Malaysia's Selangor state, to meet growing demand for cloud services and for artificial intelligence literacy programs for Malaysian students and educators.

Malaysia will be the 12th country to house a Google data center. The Malaysian Google Cloud hub — which will deliver services to large enterprises, startups and the public sector, will join 40 regions and 121 zones currently in operation around the world, it said.

“This investment builds on our partnership with the government of Malaysia to advance its ‘Cloud First Policy,’ including best-in-class cybersecurity standards,” said Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc.'s president and chief financial officer.

GOOGL,2024-05-27,"This means that we need to analyze individual quantum computing stocks to see how they have performed recently. Heading into the year's second half, investors have battled with high inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical tensions, turmoil in banking, and euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence since 2022.

Some quantum computing stocks that are commonly known are Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI), IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ), and D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS). Over the past five years, their shares have lost 89%, 24%, and 89%, respectively. Mind you though, this doesn't mean that quantum computing stocks never go up. For instance, take the example of IonQ. The firm listed its shares for trading in October after a merger, and between October 8th and November 19th, the stock soared by a whopping 233%. For comparison, Wall Street's AI darling NVIDIA's shares have gained 239% over the past twelve months.

So, the next question to ask is, what happened to this quantum computing stock? Well, part of the reason is a Goldman Sachs investment note that was released in November 2022. The note wondered when businesses would start adopting quantum computing into their operations, and whether the company's technology roadmap could align with this shift, as uncertainty persisted over ""which forms of quantum computer ultimately captures market share,"" according to analyst Toshiya Hari. After losing 14% in the wake of Hari's comments, the stock would proceed to bottom out over the new year in January, but its performance graph changes when we zoom into 2024's performance. April 2024 seems to have been the month for IonQ's shares as the stock is up by 17% since the 19th.

To make our list of the best quantum computing stocks, we first made a list of pure play quantum computing companies and those that make crucial products for the industry. These stocks were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had held shares according to the last round of 13F filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Mega cap tech giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another key player in the global quantum computing market. Like IBM and Intel, it also designs its own quantum computing chips. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also seems to be interested in the practical side of quantum computing as it announced a $5 million prize in March 2024 for those who could think of the best use cases for the technology.

After compiling hedge fund regulatory filings for Q1 2024, Insider Monkey found Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake which was worth $6.9 billion.

Click to see 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.

Billionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management recently made headlines when his latest portfolio showed the 66-year-old owner of Carolina Panthers was piling into Chinese stocks while clearly cutting his exposure to mega-cap tech stocks which have already rewarded him heftily over the past several quarters, thanks to the AI-led rally. Tepper's bet on Chinese stocks comes at a time when many analysts are predicting a rebound of Chinese economy as the government begins to devise more rescue plans for the devastated property sector. The MSCI China index is up about 10% since the end of March.

David Tepper, who founded Appaloosa Management back in 1993, returned 20% last year, thanks to his huge stake in AI stocks. A cursory analysis of David Tepper, worth over $20 billion, shows that he was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper's instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he'd joined in 1985.

Tepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the mist of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:

“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”

However, the billionaire started decreasing his hold in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) significantly in 2021. In the first quarter, Appaloosa decreased its position in Alphabet Inc.

It is the primary destination for developers exploring open-source AI models such as Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 3.

“Efficiency is crucial to us – ensuring that as many people as possible can run models cost-effectively,” said Jeff Boudier, head of product and growth at Hugging Face.

AWS aims to attract more AI developers to use its cloud services for AI delivery. While Nvidia leads in training models, AWS claims its chips can operate those trained models – an inference process – at a lower cost over time.

Recent reports indicated that Matt Garman will take over as AWS CEO, succeeding Adam Selipsky, effective June 3.

During its latest quarterly results, Amazon announced that AWS became a $100-billion annual revenue run rate business.

AWS led the global cloud service market in the fourth quarter, accounting for 31% of total cloud spending.

Amazon analysts had highlighted the upside of AI chip development and diverse large language model offerings.

Amazon stock gained 59% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR Select Sector Fund – Consumer Discretionary (NYSE:XLY) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (NYSE:FDIS).

GOOGL,2024-05-17,"ChatGPT parent OpenAI has disbanded a team dedicated to ensuring the safety of potentially ultra-capable AI systems after the group’s leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever, departed.

The so-called superalignment team, established less than a year ago under Sutskever and Jan Leike, has been absorbed into broader research efforts across the company, Bloomberg reports.

This integration aims to maintain the focus on safety while addressing the recent high-profile exits that have stirred debates over the company’s speed versus safety in AI development.

Leike resigned following Sutskever’s departure, citing challenges such as insufficient resources and increasing difficulties in conducting crucial research.

Other team members, Leopold Aschenbrenner and Pavel Izmailov, have also left OpenAI.

John Schulman will lead OpenAI’s alignment work, and Jakub Pachocki, who will take over Sutskever’s role, has been appointed the new chief scientist.

In April, the United States and the United Kingdom agreed to address the concerns about AI safety.

The Biden Administration has actively engaged tech companies and banking firms to address AI dangers. AI giants like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) joined the White House’s AI safety initiative in February.

In 2023, the AI safety forum, the Frontier Model Forum, spearheaded by OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and AI startup Anthropic, appointed its first director and announced plans to establish an advisory board soon to guide its strategy. The forum also announced plans to develop a fund to support research into the technology.

GOOGL,2024-05-15,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), one of ASML Holding NV’s (NASDAQ:ASML) significant clients, has expressed concerns about the high costs of ASML’s new advanced chip machines.

Despite appreciating the capabilities of the high-NA EUV, Zhang highlighted the economic considerations, stating that TSMC’s upcoming A16 node technology, due in late 2026, will continue to use older EUV technology instead of the new high-NA EUV machines.

He noted the rising costs of factory operations as a broader challenge for the industry, with increasing expenses for construction, tools, electricity, and raw materials.

Meanwhile, TSMC is looking to build its $11 billion European chip plant in Dresden, Germany, backed by EU and German support. The plant will produce 22-nm car chips and has plans for advanced tech expansions.

TSMC reported first-quarter revenue growth of 16.5% to $18.87 billion, surpassing the Street consensus estimate of $18.40 billion. Advanced technologies comprised 65% of TSMC’s total revenue.

Reportedly, big techs led by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) committed over $32 billion in AI infrastructure in the first quarter alone.

Price Actions: TSM shares are trading higher by 0.37% at $152.50 premarket at the last check on Wednesday. ASML shares traded higher by 0.23% at $917.11.

GOOGL,2024-05-15,"HONG KONG (AP) — YouTube has blocked access to videos of a protest song in Hong Kong, days after court approved an injunction banning the song in the city.

“Glory to Hong Kong” was an anthem of anti-government protests in 2019. YouTube said that it would comply with a removal order and block access to over 32 YouTube videos of the song that were deemed to be “prohibited publications” under the injunction.

Attempts to access the YouTube videos from Hong Kong on Wednesday showed that they were unavailable. A message showed saying that “This content is not available on this country domain due to a court order.”

In approving the government's application to ban the song, the court agreed it could be “weaponized” and used to incite secession.

“We are disappointed by the court’s decision but are complying with its removal order by blocking access to the listed videos for viewers in Hong Kong,” YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., said in an emailed statement.

“We’ll continue to consider our options for an appeal, to promote access to information,” the company said, adding that it shared the concerns of human rights organizations about the chilling effect the ban would have on free expression online.

Links to the 32 videos on YouTube will also not show up on Google Search for users in Hong Kong, according to YouTube.

George Chen, co-chair of digital practice at Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consultancy, said it is worth watching how aggressively Hong Kong authorities will be in ordering internet platforms to remove the song.

Chen, who was the former head of public policy for Greater China at Meta, said that if the government begins sending platforms hundreds of links to remove every day, that would likely undermine investor confidence in Hong Kong.

“That will hurt Hong Kong’s reputation as a leading financial center because we know how important a free flow of data and information means to a financial center,” he said. “So the government should be very careful and be aware of some unintended consequences that may impact its economic recovery and investors’ confidence.”

Internet and social media platforms such as YouTube typically have policies for removal requests from governments.

“Glory to Hong Kong” was often sung by demonstrators during massive anti-government protests in 2019. The song was later mistakenly played as the city’s anthem at international sporting events, instead of China’s “March of the Volunteers,” in mix-ups that upset city officials.

Authorities earlier arrested some residents who played the song in public under other offenses, such as playing a musical instrument in public without a permit, local media reported.

Critics have said prohibiting broadcast or distribution of the song further reduces freedom of expression since Beijing launched a crackdown in the former British colony following the 2019 protests. They have also warned the ban might disrupt the operation of tech giants and hurt the city’s appeal as a business center.

Moreover, the FOMC voted to ease the pace at which it is reducing bond holdings on the central bank’s gigantic balance sheet. The Fed started this program in June 2022, which was known as “quantitative tightening.” Its latest decision could be viewed as an incremental loosening of monetary policy.

A Goldilocks Environment?

A Goldilocks scenario is characterized as continuous economic growth but not as much a rapid pace to inflate the aggregate price level to such an extent that the central bank is compelled to tighten monetary policies.

The U.S. economy has cooled but is growing at a pace similar to that of the pre-pandemic level. The labor market shown the signs of crack but not at an alarming pace. The peak inflation rate is far behind us. Finally, there are no signs of any near-term recession. Consequently, this is a golden opportunity to enter U.S. stock markets.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL first-quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive. Also, the strength in YouTube favored the stock. Notably, a robust cloud division remains the key catalyst for GOOGL.

Expanding data centers will continue to bolster GOOGL’s presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. GOOGL’s deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.

Zacks Rank #1 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.1% and 30.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.5% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 12.6% from the last closing price of $167.24.

Netflix Inc. NFLX added 9.33 million paid subscribers globally in first-quarter 2024, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.

NFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.

Zacks Rank #1 Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 52.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 13.6% from the last closing price of $579.34.

Amazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. An expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN in gaining momentum among customers.

AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.

Zacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 56.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.7% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 16% from the last closing price of $186.21.

ServiceNow Inc. NOW has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation. NOW had 1933 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value at the end of the first quarter. NOW had eight deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV, and four deals of more than $10 million.

NOW closed 59 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV. The number of customers contributing more than $20 million or more grew 50% year over year. Generative AI deals continued to gain traction with record-breaking net new ACV for Pro Plus, making it the fastest-selling product in NOW’s history.

Zacks Rank #2 ServiceNow has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21.3% and 25.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.9% over the last 30 days. The average price target represents an increase of 19% from the last closing price of $716.65.

Boston Scientific Corp. BSX is seeing strength across target markets despite macroeconomic concerns, currency headwinds and related cost inflation. Strong worldwide demand for BSX’s GI and pulmonary treatment options, traction in Europe for its next generation WATCHMAN FLX, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers.

The Pain and Brain franchisees of BSX are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on the strong execution of core growth strategies. The EP arm received a strong boost on the FDA approval for FARAPULSE.

Zacks Rank #2 Boston Scientific has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12.3% and 13.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 30 days. The average price target represents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $72.85.

GOOGL,2024-04-30,"Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, ahead of its annual I/O developer conference in May, has confirmed layoffs across various vital teams such as Flutter, Dart, Python, and others, according to employee reports on social media.

The tech giant did not specify the teams, roles, or the number of individuals affected, TechCrunch reports.

Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert explained that these changes aim to align resources with the company’s most significant product priorities, improve efficiency, and reduce bureaucracy.

The layoffs are part of regular organizational adjustments and are not company-wide. Google encourages those affected to apply for other available positions within the company.

Despite the cuts, Google PM Kevin Moore assured the Flutter development community that they are still focused on upcoming projects, including new updates for Flutter at the I/O conference.

The company has also filed a WARN notice in California, indicating the layoff of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale.

In 2024, the tech sector surpassed last year’s layoff figures, with over 42,324 workers losing their jobs.

This comes after nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, continuing the industry’s trend of job cuts. Major companies, including Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Discord, Salesforce Inc (NASDAQ:CRM), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) have announced significant layoffs in January.

Several factors contribute to this seemingly contradictory situation. Firstly, the rapid advancement in AI technology requires substantial investments in new technologies, prompting companies to reallocate resources and reduce their workforce.

GOOG shares gained 56% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via IShares Global Comm Services ETF (NYSE:IXP) and The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC).

Price Action: GOOG shares traded lower by 0.07% at $167.78 on the last check Tuesday.

GOOGL,2024-04-30,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has aggressively recruited dozens of artificial intelligence experts from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, establishing a secretive AI laboratory in Zurich, Europe.

This move comes as the company intensifies its efforts to lead in new AI model and product development.

Apple, valued at $2.7 trillion, has been expanding its global AI and Machine Learning team by poaching many specialists from Google since hiring John Giannandrea as its top AI executive in 2018.

This includes at least 36 experts who have since joined Apple, the Financial Times reports.

In addition to its central AI teams in California and Seattle, Apple has grown its presence in Zurich, Switzerland. This expansion followed the acquisitions of two local AI startups, leading to the creation of the “Vision Lab” in Zurich.

The Zurich team has contributed to research on advanced AI models that merge text and visual inputs, which are crucial for products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple has advertised several generative AI positions in Zurich, maintaining a low profile in the area.

The company plans to showcase new generative AI features at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, potentially transforming the next iPhone into a more sophisticated voice-activated assistant with an enhanced Siri capable of interacting with all apps via voice control.

Apple analysts projected a slight increase in revenue for the March quarter and a significant guide-down for the June quarter compared to consensus, followed by a negative market reaction.

The critical event following the earnings will be Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where analysts anticipate new AI software features will be a significant highlight, with Apple experiencing a relief rally.

Analysts will be closely watching the March quarter for total revenue, focusing on revenue from China (where he expects iPhone shipments to be down 28% year-over-year) and growth in Services revenue, which he projects at 12.7% year-over-year.

Apple stock gained over 2% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK).

GOOGL,2024-04-27,"Alphabet Inc showcases robust revenue growth and a solid financial position.

Investments in AI and cloud computing signal future growth opportunities.

Regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges present ongoing threats.

Strategic acquisitions and partnerships could bolster market position.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has released its 10-Q filing on April 26, 2024, providing a detailed look into its financial performance and strategic positioning. The company continues to dominate the digital landscape with its comprehensive suite of internet services, advertising platforms, and technological innovations. A financial overview based on the latest SEC filing reveals a significant increase in revenues, from $69,787 million in the first quarter of 2023 to $80,539 million in the same period of 2024. Net income has also seen a substantial rise from $15,051 million to $23,662 million, indicating a strong financial trajectory. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect these financial highlights and delve into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape Alphabet Inc's current and future market standing.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with JNPR.

Strengths

Financial Performance and Brand Dominance: Alphabet Inc's recent financial results underscore its robust market position. The company's revenue surged by over 15% year-over-year, with net income jumping by a remarkable 57%. This financial prowess is underpinned by its dominant brand and diverse portfolio of services, including Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud. Alphabet's ability to consistently generate substantial income from operations, which increased from $17,415 million to $25,472 million, reflects its operational efficiency and the enduring appeal of its advertising platform, which remains the cornerstone of its revenue stream.

Innovation and Diversification: Alphabet Inc is not just resting on its laurels; the company is a beacon of innovation, particularly in AI and cloud computing. The 10-Q filing indicates a commitment to these areas, with expectations of increased capital expenditures to support growth, especially in AI products and services. This forward-thinking approach ensures Alphabet stays ahead in the technology race, diversifying its revenue streams beyond advertising and fortifying its long-term market position.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite its impressive financials, Alphabet Inc's heavy reliance on advertising dollars is a potential vulnerability. With over 85% of its revenue stemming from online ads, shifts in the advertising market or disruptions caused by ad-blocking technologies could significantly impact its bottom line. This dependence on a single revenue source, albeit a lucrative one, exposes Alphabet to market volatility and necessitates a strategic pivot towards more diversified income streams.

Regulatory and Legal Risks: Alphabet Inc's filing acknowledges the heightened regulatory scrutiny it faces, with ongoing legal matters and the possibility of substantial fines and penalties. These challenges not only pose a financial risk but also threaten to disrupt business practices and affect the company's reputation. As Alphabet navigates a complex global regulatory landscape, it must allocate resources judiciously to manage these risks effectively.

Opportunities

Expansion into Emerging Markets: Alphabet Inc's international performance is pivotal to its growth, with developing economies offering a vast untapped user base. As internet penetration deepens in these regions, Alphabet has the opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for digital services, potentially leading to significant revenue expansion and diversification.

Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: The company's robust balance sheet positions it well to pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships that can open new markets, enhance its product offerings, and consolidate its competitive edge. Alphabet's history of successful integrations, such as YouTube and Android, demonstrates its capability to leverage acquisitions for sustained growth and innovation.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The technology sector is characterized by rapid innovation and fierce competition. Alphabet Inc faces threats from existing tech giants and emerging startups that challenge its market share in core areas like advertising, search, and cloud services. Staying ahead requires continuous investment in R&D and a keen eye for evolving consumer preferences and technological trends.

Global Economic Uncertainty: Economic downturns and geopolitical tensions can lead to reduced advertising spending and consumer purchasing power, directly affecting Alphabet's revenue streams. The company's international operations also expose it to currency fluctuations and trade disputes, which can unpredictably impact financial performance.

In conclusion, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) presents a compelling case of a company with formidable strengths, including a solid financial foundation and a reputation for innovation. However, it must navigate the challenges of market dependence and regulatory pressures while seizing opportunities for international expansion and strategic acquisitions. The threats of competition and economic instability loom, but with prudent management and strategic foresight, Alphabet is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the digital age.

GOOGL,2024-04-26,"Markets rose Friday, boosted by earnings from Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., two of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, which both reported beats on revenue and earnings.

Microsoft's next quarter revenue outlook was higher than analyst expectations while Alphabet announced it would begin paying a $.20 a share dividend. Alphabet jumped more than 10% after the open and Microsoft rose over 2% in early trading Friday.

Rallies in the stocks boosted the broader markets, with the Nasdaq surging 2.2% and the S&P 500 adding about 1% midmorning. ETFs tracking the indexes gained similarly: SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust was 1.1% higher while QQQ, the Invesco QQQ Trust which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, popped 1.7%.

MAGS, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF which holds Mag 7 stocks in its fund soared more than 3%.

Microsoft and Alphabet's earnings surprises are helping improve the less-than-rosy picture painted earlier this earnings season by tech companies. Tech earnings have been in focus since last week as investors wondered if the megacap tech companies that have led the markets for so long would continue to do so in the future.

While Microsoft and Alphabet earnings delighted investors, Tesla Inc., Netflix Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. reported disappointing results that kept markets under pressure earlier in the week.

The Dow was little-changed, adding half a percentage point. DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust was up 0.2%.

The better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft and Alphabet helped investors look past inflation data released Friday. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March rose 0.3% for the month, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The monthly rise was in line with expectations from economists polled by Dow Jones. But the year-over-year rise of 2.7% (minus the volatile food and energy categories) highlighted how stubborn and persistent inflation has been.

The data came just a day after the Commerce Department released first quarter PCE figures, giving investors an advance preview of what was to come today. Thursday's advance reading of PCE torpedoed investor hopes that rate cuts were coming anytime soon.

PCE remains the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, and is a key piece of information for policy meetings about rate cuts. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady next week at the FOMC meeting, but questions still remain on when investors—and the economy—can anticipate relief from a high interest rate environment.",0.1696774193548387,0.4848924731182795,Positive,0.9999046325683594,0.4531615889001057

GOOGL,2024-04-25,"Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. on Thursday released a quarterly report showing it’s still reaping double-digit revenue gains from its digital advertising empire while sowing potentially lucrative new ground in artificial intelligence.

The results for the first three months of the year provided the latest evidence that Google has regained its momentum after an unprecedented downturn in 2022 coming out of the pandemic.

Alphabet punctuated its renewed vigor by also disclosing plans to begin paying shareholders a quarterly dividend for the first time since since Google went public 20 years ago. It’s something that two older technology powerhouses, Microsoft and Apple, have been doing for years. Alphabet's quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share will be paid June 17.

Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro praised the decision to pay a dividend as “a breath of fresh air for the tech market” that should also make investors more likely to support the increased amounts that Google will likely need to spend on developing AI products that could take years to pay off.

In the January-March period, Alphabet’s revenue rose 15% from the same time last year to $80.54 billion, which surpassed the projections of analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth for the Mountain View, California, company.

Alphabet earned $23.66 billion, or $1.89 per share, a 57% increase from last year's comparable quarter. The earnings per share also eclipsed the analyst estimates that steer investors.

“We are incredibly well set up, given the innovation path we are on,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday conference call.

The company's stock price soared by nearly 13% in Thursday's extended trading after the news came out. That reaction was a stark contrast to how investors responded to a report covering the same quarter from Facebook's parent. Meta Platforms also reported a surge in ad revenue but provided a disappointing outlook for the April-June period, while also warning its profits would be squeezed by increased spending on AI technology.

If Alphabet's shares move in a similar trajectory during Friday's regular trading session, the stock will hit a new all-time high that will push the company's market value above $2 trillion.

As has been the case since throughout the company's history, most of the money came in through a digital advertising network anchored by Google’s dominant search engine. Google’s ad revenue totaled $61.66 billion in the first quarter, up 13% from last year.

Despite the ongoing success, Google is facing dual threats that could threaten its future growth.

The U.S. Department of Justice is taking aim at its search engine a lawsuit alleging the company has abused its power by negotiating lucrative deals with Apple and other companies to give it an unfair advantage over potential rivals, stifling innovation as well as competition.

After a two-month trial last fall, the closing arguments in the biggest U.S. antitrust case in a quarter are scheduled to unfold next week and a federal judge is expected to rule whether Google has been breaking the law by the end of this year.

People also may not need to rely as much on Google’s search information to answer their questions and find other information as the artificial intelligence technology that Google, Microsoft and other industry stalwarts are building becomes more sophisticated. If AI gradually supplants the role that Google’s search engine has filled for the past quarter century, Alphabet’s ad sales also could dwindle.

For now, AI is helping to fuel rapid growth in Google’s cloud computing division, which saw its first-quarter revenue climb 28% from last year to $9.57 billion.

But the cloud division also has become a tinder box for Google management as dozens of employees have staged protests over a $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government that includes AI technology as part of Project Nimbus.

The protesting employees believe Project Nimbus is being lethally deployed by the Israeli military in the Gaza war — a contention Google has denied. The divisive issue came to head earlier this month during an employee sit-in at Google offices in Sunnyvale, California, and New York that resulted in more than 50 workers being fired.

Alphabet ended March with nearly 181,000 employees, a decrease of nearly 10,000 workers from the previous year. Management has cycled through several rounds of mass layoffs to help boost profits while Google ramps up its spending on AI technology.",0.0782348484848484,0.4246759906759905,Positive,0.9986159801483154,0.4331602030843449

GOOGL,2024-04-23,"Markets were in the green Tuesday as earnings season kicked into high gear, giving investors what they needed to help snap a losing streak in the S&P 500.

Companies are largely reporting earnings and sales that top forecasts, boosting investors' enthusiasm. Among the 14% of the S&P 500 having reported results by last week's end, 74% said they beat earnings expectations and 58% reported revenue beats, according to data from FactSet.

SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust jumped more than 1% after the open on Tuesday while DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust popped more than half of a percentage point.

All eyes are on tech earnings—particularly from the 'Magnificent Seven'—this week as Tesla Inc. gets ready to report earnings after the bell today. Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also on deck to report quarterly earnings this week.

QQQ, the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust soared 1.5% after the open on Tuesday. MAGS, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF which holds the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks rose roughly 1.6%.

Investors have been anxious for results from the Mag 7, looking for signs that the companies won't be able to sustain the levels of growth that have surpassed the broader market.

Year to date, MAGS has jumped more than 9%, and is roughly 48% higher than last year. In contrast, the S&P 500 has only risen 5% since the beginning of the year and 21% since last year.

According to etf.com data, tech ETFs are among the most active Tuesday. SQQQ, the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ which bets on falling tech prices was the most active with a trading volume of more than 67 million. QQQ, and TQQQ saw trading volumes of 17 million and 37 million respectively.

Top gainers on Tuesday included NVDX, the T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF, and NVDL, the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF. Both ETFs jumped 5% and 7% respectively as investors geared up for earnings from the Mag 7. Investors will have to wait another month before NVIDIA reports.

CONL, the GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily ETF saw the biggest pop Tuesday, rising over 9% before paring some gains. The pop in the leveraged ETF which tracks Coinbase stock comes just days after the bitcoin halving, an event where the reward for bitcoin miners is halved, contributing to scarcity of the digital asset. Halvings usually precede a rally in bitcoin prices, which would be a boost for Coinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.",0.1778281068524971,0.4502497096399534,Positive,0.9999974966049194,0.4439707391056943

This week’s earnings lineup features four Magnificent Seven giants like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which will report on Tuesday, followed by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) on Wednesday, and both Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) slated for Thursday.

PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) led Monday’s rally among the Nasdaq 100 stocks by rallying over 9%, followed by Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), which climbed 4.4% after experiencing a sharp 10% drop on Friday. The chip sector, represented by the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) showed strength, advancing 1.9% for the day.

Last week marked the Nasdaq 100 Index’s largest weekly drop in over 17 months, dragging the index to its longest losing streak since December 2022.

UBS Cautions In Tech Sector

UBS Group AG's chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub has advised caution on tech stocks.

As reported by Bloomberg, UBS downgraded its stance on the ‘Big 6’ technology giants—Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia Corp.— from Overweight to Neutral amid slowing earnings momentum.

Golub suggests that the downturn in tech earnings momentum will be driven by wider cyclical challenges, not by worries about valuations or the industry's prospects in artificial intelligence.

GOOGL,2024-04-09,"Uber Technologies, Inc’s (NYSE:UBER) Uber Eats is introducing a TikTok-style short-form video feature to enhance food discovery and enable restaurants to highlight their offerings more vividly.

This feature, which is currently undergoing testing in New York, San Francisco, and Toronto, represents Uber Eats’ foray into the burgeoning realm of short-form video content, aligning with a trend popularized by platforms like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Instagram, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), and recently Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) LinkedIn.

The feature showcases videos in a swipeable format, visible in carousels throughout the app, including the home screen, TechCrunch reports.

These videos aim to give users a closer look at food preparation, textures, portion sizes, and dish compositions, ultimately boosting consumer confidence in trying new dishes.

Notably, the content is offered to users based on the proximity of the restaurants, ensuring relevance and delivery feasibility.

Uber Eats’ approach differentiates from typical advertising; it doesn’t charge merchants for these video placements, offering a unique platform for restaurants to connect directly with potential customers.

This move is particularly significant as many restaurants leverage social media to attract new patrons and showcase their culinary creations.

Introducing this feature into the Uber Eats app aims to streamline the discovery process and encourage users to seek culinary inspiration within the app itself.

Uber Eats is also enhancing its support for merchants by revamping the Uber Eats Manager software with personalized growth recommendations and preparing to launch a new app for restaurant managers to facilitate on-the-go business management.

Prior reports indicated Microsoft’s LinkedIn testing a TikTok-like short-form video feed enabling users to interact with vertical short videos by liking, commenting, and sharing. This move by LinkedIn focuses on career-oriented and professional content.

Reports also suggested that Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) explore full-length music videos to appeal to the Gen Z audience. Meta expanded its short video offerings with the global launch of “Reels” in February 2022, while Google reported in June 2022 that YouTube “Shorts” had garnered over 1.5 billion logged-in monthly viewers. Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also entered the fray in August 2022, trialing a TikTok-like photo and video feed within its shopping app to facilitate product discovery.

Uber stock gained over 136% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSE:FPX) and Global X Millennial Consumer ETF (NASDAQ:MILN).

Price Action: UBER shares traded lower by 0.05% at $75.00 on the last check Tuesday.

GOOGL,2024-04-08,"Have you been investing in FAANG stocks or even the “Magnificent 7,” which is a collection of tech-focused U.S.-based stocks? In 2013, four tech stocks stood out, earning the collective name, “FANG.” In 2017, the acronym expanded to encompass Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.

In 2023, the Magnificent 7 moniker emerged to describe an expanded group of tech stocks: Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Apple, Alphabet Inc. (formerly Google), Nvidia Corp., and Tesla.

But there’s another name savvy investors should know: GRANOLAS. These stocks don’t (necessarily) have anything to do with the crunchy treat preferred by hikers and healthy snack enthusiasts. Rather, they are 11 European-based companies that represent a broad cross-section of the market, ranging from luxury brands to biopharmaceutical companies.

In spite of being international brands, many are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet, they are not correlated strongly with the S&P 500, according to SeekingAlpha.com.

The stocks in the category are: GSK, Roche, ASML, Nestle, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, L’Oreal, LVMH, AstraZeneca, SAP, and Sanofi.

Today’s investors are finding multiple reasons to diversify their holdings into the GRANOLAS stocks.

GRANOLAS Stocks Have Outperformed the Market Since June 2022

This diverse collection of stocks has delivered 60% of the gains in the European stock market in the past year, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, and have outperformed the FAANG stocks for the past two years, Morningstar.com reported.

Plus, most of the stocks on the list deliver dividends of 2% to 2.5%.

They Provide Diversification

While tech stocks tend to fare well in the U.S., a portfolio made up of FAANG stocks doesn’t provide much diversification. On the other hand, the GRANOLAS stocks represent sectors ranging from consumer goods to fashion, technology and healthcare.

They also aren’t tied to the S&P 500 or Nasdaq index. If the bulk of your portfolio is filled with U.S.-based stocks, adding some shares of even a handful of the GRANOLAS could serve you well.

Because of the diversity of the companies on the list, the collection also shows less volatility than the Magnificent 7. “The realized volatility of the GRANOLAS is on average 2x lower than for the Magnificent 7,” Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer recently told SeekingAlpha.com.",0.2318046536796536,0.4068587662337662,Neutral,0.9984105825424194,0.4731705917329517

GOOGL,2024-06-30,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. You can also check out the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Under $10 here.

Cloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.

The growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.

Currently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.

Even with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.

The Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

13. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)

“Mastercard is a company that pretty much everyone has heard of. In fact, when we meet with Ensemble’s clients, we occasionally tell them that we’re nearly certain that they are carrying a Mastercard in their wallet or purse as we speak, and if not, they are carrying a Visa Inc.

“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) (7.60% weight in the Fund): Earlier this year, Booking Holdings rolled out an AI trip planner. Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”

Number of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with 28 million shares worth more than $4.1 billion.

In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares closed slightly lower during Tuesday’s session.

MacRumors has reported that Apple is potentially introducing a “custom routes” feature in iOS 18. The discovery was made through a review of code associated with Apple Maps.

This feature will allow users to enter their chosen navigation paths, marking a significant expansion from the current pre-selected routes.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.57%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents per share (96 cents a year).

So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,060,688 or around 6,250 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $212,138 or around 1,250 shares.

Read This: Top 3 Energy Stocks That May Keep You Up At Night In Q1

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.96 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple were up 1.5% to $172.38 at the time of publication Wednesday.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) recently acquired DarwinAI, an artificial intelligence (AI) visual quality assurance startup that provides an end-to-end solution for improving product quality while increasing production efficiency.

Founded in 2017 by Alexander Wong, Canada's research chair in AI, DarwinAI has garnered significant attention, raising over $17 million from investors including Honeywell Ventures and BDC Venture Capital.

Darwin AI's patented Explainable AI (XAI) platform has been adopted by numerous Fortune 500 companies. It integrates AI they can trust and results they can see. Wong led the development of the company's XAI platform, according to its LinkedIn page.

Apple’s acquisition of DarwinAI aligns with its longstanding practice of discreetly assimilating innovative technology firms into its ecosystem. When questioned by Bloomberg, Apple maintained its characteristic silence regarding its plans, citing a standard response employed across previous acquisitions: ""[Apple] buys smaller technology companies from time to time but doesn't discuss its plans.""

The tech giant’s recent unveiling of the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air hints at its ambitions in the AI sphere. Marketed as the “world’s best consumer laptop for AI,” the MacBook Air boasts a robust ecosystem of AI-powered applications. From AI Math Assistance in Goodnotes 6 to image enhancement in Pixelmator Pro, Apple emphasizes the device’s capacity to leverage AI functionalities seamlessly.

""Combined with the unified memory architecture of Apple silicon, MacBook Air can also run optimized AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models for image generation locally with great performance,"" according to Apple's announcement.

Trending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

Last December, Apple researchers shared advancements in local AI processing. Their paper “LLM in a Flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited Memory” showcases innovations enabling the efficient execution of complex language models directly on user devices.

""Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory,"" according to the paper.

These developments suggest Apple’s covert efforts toward creating a first-of-its-kind device capable of executing AI applications natively on hardware. By circumventing traditional server-based AI processing, Apple seeks to redefine the landscape of consumer technology with unparalleled performance and privacy assurances.

In the race to lead the AI revolution, Apple’s clandestine maneuvers may position it as the frontrunner, poised to deliver AI-powered experiences directly into the hands of consumers.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"American Express

The GF Value chart shows American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) to be fairly valued after the recent surge of over 58% from its October 2023 lows. American Express is a great company that Buffett has owned for decades. Its ROIC consistently exceeds its WACC.

Founded in 1850, American Express is known principally for its charge cards but also extends credit and provides a suite of related services to businesses and merchants. The company is positioned at the higher end of the card business. Despite the competitive nature of the industry, it has averaged about 10% earnings per share growth over many years, through above-average revenue growth and ongoing share buybacks.

Overall, I think American Express is a weak buy if you do not already own it. If you own it, I think it is best to wait for a more opportunistic entry point to buy more. It is a proven compounder of shareholder capital and though right now its not a bargain, buying it now is unlikely to cause regret in the future. However, be aware that the best opportunity to buy American Express happens when the fear of a recession is in the air like last year. With a booming economy like at present, American Express is on the expensive side. Berkshire owns more than 20% of its stock.

Buffett said, ""The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""

Occidental Petroleum

Berkshire owns 27.80% of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) shares as well as holds options to increase its stake further, but Buffett emphasized that he has no desire to own the company outright. The guru likes Occidental's vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of the latter technique has yet to be proven. However, clearly it will be needed in the future due to the inevitability of climate change and societal pressure to do something about it. Both of these activities, he said, are very much in the country's interest, giving the investment a patriotic flavor. Buffett likes the fact that Occidental's holdings are in the U.S. (thus safe from a geopolitical turbulence) and very much needed to maintain U.S. energy independence from foreign oil, which he sees as a risk to the country. Thus, his holdings in Occidental somewhat of a hedge against global conflict and turbulence.

Occidental looks modestly overvalued according to the GF Value Line. However, I think we should look at the stock from the lens Buffett is using that it is a domestic oil and gas major, and thus much safer than other large multinational oil and gas companies with comparable reserves outside the U.S. Further, like all oil and gas companies, it is very cyclical.

Buffett is a multibillionaire and is not bothered by volatility. However, most investors are not multibillionaires, so factor that in. All in all, I would wait for a better entry point.

Japanese holdings

Berkshire currently holds approximately 9% ownership in each of five Japanese companies. Buffett said in his letter that Berkshire has made a commitment to these companies that it will not acquire shares exceeding a 9.90% stake. The total cost of these holdings amounts to 1.60 trillion yen ($10.75 billion), while the year-end market value stands at 2.90 trillion yen. However, due to the yen's recent weakening, Berkshire's unrealized gain in dollars reached 61%, equivalent to $8 billion.

These companies are often referred to as Sogo-Shosha, which translates to ""general trading companies,"" and form a crucial part of the Japanese economy. However, they have greatly evolved from their trading roots and are now conglomerates of many trading, real estate and industrial businesses.

The first is Itochu Corp. (TSE:8001), a diversified conglomerate with interests spanning various sectors. Historically, it played a crucial role in importing energy, minerals and food into Japan. Today, its portfolio extends beyond trade activities to include logistics, real estate, frozen foods and even investments in electric vehicles and renewable energy.

Next is Marubeni Corp. (TSE:8002), another significant player in Japan's trading landscape. Like its peers, it has a diverse portfolio, including energy, agriculture and infrastructure. The company has adapted to changing market dynamics and expanded into non-trade areas such as real estate and aerospace.

Third, Mitsubishi Corp. (TSE:8058) has a rich history and has been instrumental in Japan's economic development. Traditionally, it focused on importing raw materials and exporting finished products. Today, the company's interests span various industries, including automotive, machinery and finance. It has also ventured into newer areas like EVs and renewable energy.

Mitsui & Co. Ltd. (TSE:8031) is one of the oldest sogo-shosha companies, with its roots tracing back to the Edo period. Over time, it has diversified its business lines, including investments in infrastructure, chemicals and health care. Mitsui's very long-term approach aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy.

Last but not least is Sumitomo Corp. (TSE:8053). It has a storied history dating back centuries. The company has been involved in copper mining, banking and trade. In recent years, Sumitomo has expanded into diverse sectors, such as real estate, logistics and telecommunications. Its focus on value and cash flow resonates with Buffett's investment principles.

The table below provides a snapshot of these companies basic fundamentals:

Since Buffett purchased the five companies about three years ago, they are up substantially in yen terms and even more in U.S. dollar terms as the yen has weakened. The following chart shows the price appreciation over the last three years.

While the five companies may not be household names globally, they play critical roles in Japan's economic landscape, which is similar to the role Berkshire plays in the U.S. Buffett's interest in these Japanese companies reflects their stability, diversified portfolios and long-term vision. He appreciates their similarities to Berkshire Hathaway, emphasizing value and understanding the businesses they operate.

Buffett said in his letter that because he cannot accurately forecast major currency market prices, Berkshire had financed a significant portion of its Japanese stock position using the proceeds from 1.30 trillion yen in bond sales. This debt issue has been well-received in Japan, and Berkshire likely holds more yen-denominated debt than any other American company. The weakened yen since then has resulted in a year-end gain of $1.90 billion for Berkshire, which, in accordance with GAAP rules, has been recognized in income over the 2020 to 2023 period. Thus, not only have the stock prices of the Japanese companies gone up substantially, but the debt Berkshire took on has diminished in U.S. dollar terms, resulting in a one-two punch in favor of Berkshire.

Buffett said in his letter that all five Japanese companies adhere to shareholder-friendly policies that surpass typical U.S. practices. Since Berkshire initiated its purchases, each of these companies has reduced their outstanding shares at attractive prices. Additionally, he says, their management teams exhibit ""less aggressiveness"" regarding compensating themselves compared to U.S. norms. Furthermore, each allocates only about one-third of its earnings to dividends, retaining substantial sums for business expansion and share repurchases. Like Berkshire, these companies are cautious about issuing new shares. From the tone of the letter, it looks like Buffett is really pleased with his ownership of the Japanese sogo-soshas and are companies he intends to hold indefinitely.

Other potential ""forever"" stocks

Buffett had surprisingly little to say about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his letter, given the extremely large part of Berkshire's portfolio invested in the stock. Apple now constitutes over 50% of Berkshire's non-controlled equity investment portfolio. It own 5.86% of Apple's outstanding shares.

The tech giant looks fairly valued on the GF Value Line. I don't think we can go wrong with Apple at the present time given its dominance in mobile tech and wide competitive moat.

Another stock is Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), which is Buffett's second-highest conviction stock after Apple and over 10% of his portfolio is in it. Berkshire owns about 13% of the bank's outstanding stock. It is also in fairly valued territory.

Conclusion

So that's it folks. These are Buffett's ""indefinite hold"" or ""close enough to forever"" stocks gleaned from his latest letter. At present, I think only Coca-Cola is a clear buy and the rest are weak buys. I like Apple and if it comes down a bit more, I may take the plunge.

Buffett's Japanese investments are very interesting, but I would rather hold them indirectly through my ownership of Berkshire stock to avoid the foreign exchange risk. The purchase of the five conglomerates was a master stroke. It is interesting to note that while Buffett has been building up his Japanese exposure, he has been reducing his Chinese and Taiwanese exposure. He has been selling down his BYD (SZSE:002594) position and has exited his Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) position. While he did not disclose a reason, I think it may be because of geopolitical concerns.

The guru's approach is pretty much safety first and very long-term thinking. Watching his portfolio is like watching paint dry. Like he says, the first rule of investing is not to lose money and the second rule is to see the first rule. It is very interesting to see this philosophy in action with his biggest holdings.",0.1488588137190621,0.425352290911297,Positive,0.9962446093559264,0.506413012481099
AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 fastest growing AI stocks to invest in now. To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now.

Tech: A High-Growth Sector

If you're looking for high growth stocks to invest in, the tech sector is one of the best places to start. Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be exceptional additions to any growth portfolios as this revolutionary technology continues to expand and grow to bigger heights than ever seen before. However, the fact that AI is an exciting place to invest in right now does not automatically mean that every AI stock in the market is a good growth pick for investors. Resultantly, it's important to ensure that investors carefully pick out the AI stocks that can actually deliver on their promises of growth instead of the ones that can't.

On March 15, Eric Lynch, the Portfolio Manager at Scharf Investments, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss this dilemma in the AI space where investors may not know which businesses can actually grow their earnings. Here's what he had to say:

""We're at a kind of 'where's the beef?' moment for AI, where all the promises need to be delivered this year. If you look at investors' reactions to several AI stories in the past week, you know Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Oracle, and most recently with Adobe yesterday, what you're seeing is a reaction to slower growth than expected.""

Winners in Artificial Intelligence in 2024

According to Lynch, many AI companies today are lagging behind on their promises and cannot perform on par with the expectations leveled at them. As a result, it is becoming ever more important to separate the winners from the losers in this space. Lynch noted the following on which companies he sees as winners in AI:

""Obviously the chipmakers and the hyperscalers, we've seen that in the stock prices, NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, and most recently, Oracle. Oracle is really guiding for 50% infrastructure cloud growth going forward, because its use case was really generative AI, that it needed for its superior tech stack. So, these names are really benefitting.""

These ""winning"" AI stocks, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), are also among the top high growth stocks in the tech and AI sector today and have exciting developments brewing in 2024. For instance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has its GTC Conference coming soon this March, where CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote on what to expect from the company this year. Stifel's equity research analyst, Ruben Roy, joined CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on March 15 to discuss what to expect from the keynote. Here's what he said:

""I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion on the product roadmap - NVIDIA has increased the cadence at which they bring new products to the market, I think that's really interesting. I think there's gonna be a discussion around the ecosystem that's building around their AI offerings, so it's not just about hardware, right, we're not considering NVIDIA just a chip company anymore. It's a systems company, a software company, it's a networking company. And so I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion, again, around this concept of an AI ecosystem that NVIDIA has been busy building.""

Investors interested in artificial intelligence stocks should thus keep their eyes on the upcoming GTC conference, which is expected to bring together tech professionals for stimulating discussions on the future of AI and its impact on the world. Additionally, keeping up with the news on which AI stocks can reasonably be considered high growth stocks is also important at this point in time. As such, we have compiled a list of the fastest-growing AI stocks today, including some of the most promising AI stocks to buy and some of the most advanced AI companies to invest in.

Rate Cuts in June

As the US economy continues to settle down, financial professionals are continuing to keep a close eye on the inflation numbers and what they may imply for the markets and investors moving forward. Many are concerned about the Federal Reserve's next steps in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate cuts. Recent sentiments from the Fed have led many to believe that rate cuts may be on the way, but the progression of this process may be slower than most expected. On March 15, Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Financial Group, joined CNBC's ""The Exchange"" to discuss recent developments in this area. Here are some of his comments:

""Based on his [Powell's] testimony, just last week, he seems to wanna cut, but he wants to do it slowly and carefully, as he said.""

According to Boockvar, June is very much a possibility for a rate cut this year, particularly because it seems as though the Fed's Jerome Powell will want to position his rate cuts as far away as possible from the US Presidential election. The impact of this drawn-out strategy on the market may well be something to keep an eye on.

The NVIDIA GTC Conference

Apart from inflation news, investors should look at the position and performance of stocks in the market that have been performing well enough to keep rising. A good place to start on this front is to consider the performance of the most owned stocks by hedge funds in 2023 and beyond, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). However, perhaps one of the most exciting stocks to look at right now is the semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In the third week of March, the company is organizing its GTC Conference, bringing together tech professionals, developers, researchers, and engineers. The main topic at the 2024 GTC is going to be artificial intelligence, an area that is ripe for investment at present. On March 15, CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos joined the ""Halftime Report"" to highlight the main things to expect from the Conference. Here's what she said:

""The first thing is gonna be any update of their [NVIDIA's] architecture for a new AI chip, the Blackwell B100. We'll wanna know specs, you know, how is the memory content, if the memory content surpasses AMD's latest chip, then that's gonna be a negative for AMD. Then we'll also wanna know, maybe, some details on the average selling price, because that'll affect margins... The second major point is this adoption across enterprise... And last, not least, inferencing. Inferencing is the second part of a Large Language Model, you shoot the training in and use the training data to answer queries. On the earnings call, Jensen Huang, the CEO, said that 40% of data center revenue actually came from inferencing.""

These comments highlight the fact that the remainder of March is going to be exciting for the tech sector, particularly the AI space, so investors should keep a sharp eye on how the GTC Conference develops. Tech is an area that makes up a large part of the list of most owned stocks by hedge funds today. As such, our list below contains many of the fastest growing technology companies in the US, alongside some of the best American tech stocks to buy.

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will take a look at the 30 most expensive cities to live in the US in 2024. If you would like to skip our discussion on the US economy, you can go to the 5 Most Expensive Cities to Live in the US in 2024.

In June 2022, inflation in the US reached its highest point in four decades but subsequently decreased by December 2023. This decline can be attributed to actions such as the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates, improvements in supply chain efficiency, and a reduction in gasoline prices. However, despite the drop in inflation, it remains significantly high compared to pre-pandemic levels. The overall inflation rate in the US as of February 2024 stood at 3.2%, up from 3.1% in January. While inflation has decreased from its peak of 9.1% in 2022, it remains significantly higher than the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. This situation has led to financial difficulties for many Americans.

Comparing prices in December 2023 to those in January 2020 reveals a significant increase, with overall prices rising by 19%, food prices by 25%, energy prices by 26%, and shelter service prices by 21%. Meanwhile, wages for workers in private industries saw a rise of 4.3% by December 2023, compared to 5.1% in December 2022. Furthermore, US employers are planning to increase salaries by an average of 4.0% in 2024. This is slightly lower than the 4.4% increase in 2023 but still higher than the 3.1% increase seen in previous years. In 2023, pay raises outpaced inflation for the first time since 2020, highlighting a more stable job market compared to the period from 2008 to 2020.

In January 2024, the unemployment rate remained stable at 3.7% for the past three months, marking a decrease from January 2021, when it stood at 6.4%. However, despite these positive signs in the job market, the high inflation rate has continued to impact major companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). In October 2023, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), voiced concerns about the effects of increased interest rates, stating that they offset the benefits of Tesla's price reductions and lower people's ability to purchase cars. Additionally, the higher interest rates and global economic uncertainties have impacted Tesla's plans to expand its factory in Mexico.

Here's what Fred Alger Management said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:

“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla’s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company’s full self-driving capabilities.”",0.0842056846662109,0.4271992481203007,Neutral,0.7693501114845276,0.4782798091027579

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Apple Inc. is the second most valuable company in the world, approaching a $3 trillion market capitalization. Roughly 64% of Americans own an Apple product, meaning the company has massive amounts of data, and control, over the lives of hundreds of millions of people. But, the company also acts as a gatekeeper to the millions of businesses that use the Apple platform, giving it considerable control over businesses around the world.

For example, Apple charges a 30% fee on nearly every transaction for digital goods on the Apple app store. If you buy digital currency, game skins, movies or any other digital product on the Apple App Store, you are subject to this 30% fee. This has caused many of the largest names in the world to cut or amend their pricing to all because of this massive fee.

In 2018, Netflix Inc. halted all new subscriptions using Apple's App Store billing as the giant wanted a 30% cut and wouldn't let new users transact outside of Apple. After regulatory pressures and lawsuits, Apple eventually allowed Netflix users to circumvent the 30% fee by directing them to the Netflix website. Netflix subscribers haven't been able to subscribe to Netflix using the App Store billing since 2018, but many remained on their pre-2018 plans, meaning Apple took their fees. Last month, Netflix announced it would be forcing some users to change their billing method away from the App Store or risk their accounts being closed.

Amazon.com Inc. went through a similar issue with its Prime Video services, before cutting a deal to integrate with AppleTV to avoid the hefty fee.

One of the most outspoken critics of this policy is Fortnite creator and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Sweeney, an outspoken Apple critic for years, recently sued the tech giant. The company sells billions of dollars in digital goods per year on Fortnite, meaning the company pays millions in fees for those who play the game on mobile devices. Despite attempts to circumvent the issue, Apple has maintained a strong grip on Epic and others.

The equity strategy team at UBS has recently shared a forward-looking forecast for potential surprises that might unfold throughout the course of 2024. In a note written by analyst Andrew Garthwaite and his team, they clarified that the predictions outlined carry long odds and are not reflective of the bank's base-case scenario or market consensus. One of the noteworthy surprises highlighted by UBS involves the possibility of China's nominal GDP experiencing a slowdown to 3%, contrary to expectations of acceleration. Additionally, the forecast includes a potential steepening of the yield curve to 2%, challenging current market expectations. Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape.

Among the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year.

The United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a ""Goldilocks"" moment. Economists from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) anticipate faster growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in 2024. This outlook stands in stark contrast to the recession fears that prevailed in 2023. The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year. NABE forecasts a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, compared to 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Another important indicator for the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures gauge, is also predicted to ease further. The NABE anticipates the Federal Reserve initiating a reduction in its benchmark interest rate between April and June, aiming to lower borrowing costs for individuals and businesses. The record-high performance of the stock market, with both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching new highs, contributes to the positive sentiment in the American stock market.

Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Yardeni Research, told CBS News on February 26:

""As occurred during the second half of the 1990s, the stock market is having a significantly positive wealth effect on the economy now that the major stock market indexes are at record highs.”

To benefit from the growth potential in the stock markets, some of the best stocks to buy include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Wendy’s is an asset-light franchisor that earns most of its profits from royalties, franchise fees and rent.

10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64

American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an integrated payments company operating globally, providing credit cards, charge cards, banking, and related payment and financing products.

American Express plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.70, starting from the Q1 declaration.

“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.”

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

“The full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

Consumer electronics are widely used in households, with televisions featuring larger screens gaining popularity, while electrical components are becoming more compact. Companies are focusing on creating high-performance, user-friendly devices to meet the growing demand. This trend, along with technological advancements and digitalization, is expected to drive the demand for electronic items and household appliances. The global consumer electronics market was valued at $738.75 billion in 2022, $773.40 billion in 2023, and is projected to grow to $1,239.40 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 6.97% during the forecast period from 2024-2030, as per Fortune Business Insights. The increasing popularity of smart homes is driving the adoption of smart appliances worldwide. These appliances come with features like voice assistance, bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, offering greater convenience. As people's income levels rise, they are investing more in housing and equipping their homes with advanced technological products. The introduction of innovative household products is expected to further boost consumption. Governments worldwide are also supporting the growth of the electronics industry. For example, India aims to reach a $300 billion electronics manufacturing and export market by 2025-26, encouraging the development of technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and machine learning.

Analysts expect the US consumer electronics industry to rebound in 2024 after two years of decline, as reported by Investor’s Business Daily. The Consumer Technology Association forecasts a 2.8% increase in retail sales, reaching $512 billion this year, compared to a 3.1% decrease to $498 billion in 2023. This turnaround is attributed to a refresh cycle for personal computers, smartphones, and other devices purchased during the COVID crisis. The surge in remote work, distance learning, and stay-at-home orders during the pandemic led to increased purchases of consumer electronics and digital services. Moreover, the introduction of artificial intelligence features is expected to drive upgrades of PCs, smartphones, and other devices in 2024, according to Richard Kowalski, senior director of business intelligence for the CTA. He commented:

“AI is already incorporated in many devices and services. Think about the natural language processing in our digital assistants, computer vision in our vehicle safety systems and health tracking algorithms in our smartwatches.”

The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 contributed to consumer awareness and interest in generative AI, as per Brian Comiskey, CTA's director of thematic programs. Comiskey anticipates augmented reality and virtual reality headsets to be growth drivers in consumer electronics this year. The Consumer Technology Association predicts that consumer software and services revenue will outpace hardware sales, growing by 3.8% to $163 billion. This segment is led by entertainment software and services, including audio, video, and gaming. On the other hand, consumer electronics hardware sales are expected to increase by 2.3% to $349 billion, reversing a 5.4% decline in 2023.

The Consumer Electronics Show 2024 was a showcase of cutting-edge technology and a glimpse into the future of tech. According to Forbes, Artificial intelligence and machine learning took the spotlight, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) introducing new GenAI-powered Alexa experiences.

“Reviewing Vizio (NYSE:VZIO), we purchased it quite recently and it has declined precipitously in our brief period of ownership. They have an explicit strategy to sacrifice gross margins from their TVs to further develop the audience for their smart TV offering, a competitor to Roku. I purchased the shares expecting the thesis to play out over a number of years, so I intend to monitor the company and its results as we move forward. Their first quarter results reflected strength in their Platform (Smart TV) segment, which will be their primary source of profit going forward. Further, the news that Netflix and other streaming companies are considering subscriptions that include advertising is positive news. In some ways, what is old is new again, as this development is somewhat of a return to the dual-revenue-stream model cable TV channels use. The shift towards more streaming programming including advertisements is a positive for Vizio, since they may be able to monetize the ads directly or indirectly. I’ll keep you posted on their progress.”

Here is what Roubaix Capital has to say about GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) in their Q4 2020 investor letter:

“Companies like GoPro (GPRO) should benefit from the consumer rebound, but also have their own unique drivers of value over the next 2+ years. In the case of GPRO, the company launched its newest action camera, the GoPro9, under the umbrella of a new business model. The company offers a discount on the camera when customers purchase a subscription agreement that comes with additional services and benefits. The uptake of the subscription has been strong to date and offers the company a line of sight to a higher margin and more predictable revenue stream. The stock’s low double digit earnings multiple remains undemanding. We have seen this type of transformation play out in numerous situations in software, hardware and even retail companies such as RH. We see GPRO following suit and expect a return to travel later this year to be another reason for consumers to buy a new camera as they head back out on vacation.”

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we discuss 12 stocks most bought by hedge funds. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape and the performance of popular hedge funds, head over to 5 Stocks Most Bought By Hedge Funds.

In 2023, the world's top 20 hedge funds delivered significant returns of $67 billion, tripling the previous year's performance, as reported by LCH Investments in January 2024. TCI Fund Management, headed by billionaire Christopher Hohn, led the group with $12.9 billion in returns after fees. On average, the top 20 managers achieved a 10.5% gain in 2023, surpassing the industry's overall return of 6.4%. Multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, Millennium Management, and D. E. Shaw, known for using leverage, were the top three funds by lifetime gains. Despite representing only 4.6% of the industry's assets, these three firms generated 38.3% of the industry's returns over the past three years. Citadel, with $74 billion in gains since 1990, maintained its leading position in 2023, returning 15.3%, while also deciding to return approximately $7 billion to investors. Pershing Square, led by William Ackman, re-entered the rankings for the first time since 2015, securing the 20th position with $18.8 billion in returns since 2004, and achieving a return of 26.7% in 2023, outperforming the broader stock market. On the other hand, Bridgewater Associates and Caxton Associates were the only firms among the top 20 that posted losses. The strong performance in 2023 followed a challenging 2022 marked by market turbulence due to the war in Ukraine and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The top 20 hedge funds have collectively generated substantial profits, totaling $755.4 billion since their inception, surpassing their total managed assets of $655.5 billion, according to the research findings.

Brad Amiee, Director and Head of Research at LCH Investments, attributes the success of leading hedge funds in 2023 to the impressive performance of the stock market during the year. He noted that in addition to benefiting from the overall positive market conditions, many of these funds demonstrated particularly astute stock selection strategies. In a statement to Financial Times, Amiee said:

“You could argue that, since shorting is such a challenging sub-strategy, keeping things long-biased and having a concentrated portfolio of high quality positions has been the way to go.”

The robust performance of top financiers correlates with the overall stock market rally in 2023, particularly benefiting hedge funds that focus on specific stock picks. Many in the industry have heavily invested in the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. However, concerns are rising on Wall Street about the concentration of investments in these same companies. The data highlights a growing disparity in the hedge fund industry, with the top 20 firms managing just under 19% of the total $3.5 trillion assets but representing 46% of the sector's cumulative gains.

In 2024, global hedge funds are facing pressure to enhance returns due to a robust stock rally and increased bond yields, aiming to counteract investor outflows. Last year, investors withdrew a net $75 billion from hedge funds, following a significant outflow of $112 billion in 2022. Investors, seeking double-digit returns in 2024, are interested in credit, global macro, commodity, and equity long/short strategies. Some potential approaches include adopting ""barbell"" portfolios and exploring bond-trading strategies, given the potential impact of rising rates on refinancing costs for companies. Hedge funds focusing on diverse macroeconomic signals are also gaining attention, particularly as central banks are expected to adjust monetary policies.

Some of the most owned stocks by hedge funds include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Jackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Apple Inc. is constantly looking for new and innovative ways to spend its $73 billion war chest. From the Vision Pro to the Apple Car, it's rolling out new products and producing the next generation of consumer technology. Last week, it was reported that its decade-long Apple Car project is coming to an end. But it looks like the trillion-dollar titan has a new focus: artificial intelligence.

In a bold move toward integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its ecosystem, Apple is setting the stage to unveil a series of generative AI-based tools at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. This initiative, part of iOS 18, signifies a significant leap in Apple’s AI strategy, showcasing a new version of Siri enhanced with generative AI capabilities. The upgrade promises a range of new functionalities, aiming to revolutionize user interactions with Apple devices​​.

Don't Miss:

This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

This $0.25 per share Boston startup is fixing a glaring problem with today's online advertising and is currently crowdfunding.

Apple’s AI ambitions extend beyond Siri. The company is reportedly planning to introduce an AI-based tool for completing lines of software code, akin to Microsoft Corp.‘s Copilot. Microsoft continues to be a magnate in the AI space. It has invested billions in OpenAI in a profit-sharing agreement that has also helped power the company's suite of AI-based tools.

This tool, expected to be integrated into Apple’s Xcode software, could simplify the development process by automatically completing code blocks, potentially transforming how developers work on the Apple platform. In addition to code completion, Apple is exploring AI features for automating Apple Music playlists and enhancing its business presentation software. These advancements indicate Apple’s broader goal to infuse AI across its product range, enhancing user experience and productivity​​.

Trending: Peter Thiel, Mark Cuban and Warren Buffett funded early-stage startups and made millions. You don't need to be a well-connected billionaire to do the same.

Apple’s approach to AI development is characterized by strategic partnerships and technological innovation. The company has been in talks with major publishers for rights to train its generative AI systems using their content, aiming for multiyear agreements. This step underscores Apple’s commitment to refining its AI capabilities through access to vast data sets, ensuring that its AI tools are both powerful and informed by a wide range of information sources​​.",0.0805500658761528,0.5723649538866931,Positive,0.9409745931625366,0.5131662181308416
AAPL,2025-04-22,"Roundhill Investments, the thematic ETF issuer with $870.7 million in assets, is doubling down on the Magnificent Seven with a pair of funds, including one for bets the stocks will rise and the other for investors who want to profit on their decline.

The asset manager known for its metaverse and gaming exchange-traded funds launched the Roundhill Daily 2X Long Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGX), which offers twice the daily performance of the famed seven tech equities, by investing at least 80% of its portfolio in equal weight exposure to Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Tesla Inc. The Roundhill Daily Inverse Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGQ) give inverse exposure to the same basket of stocks.

The funds, which began trading today, are designed for ""sophisticated traders,"" the company said in a statement. MAGX dropped 1.6% to $25.15 in afternoon trading while MAGQ rose 0.1% to $24.86.

The seven stocks were coined the “Magnificent Seven” as they largely drove the bull market that started last year. The group makes up about a quarter of the value of the 3,700 or so publicly traded U.S. companies. Fueled by artificial intelligence excitement and the launch of AI products such as Chat GPT, investors bet big on chipmakers like Nvidia and chatbot creators such as Microsoft.

“We saw an opportunity to provide both investors and traders with the full toolkit to express their opinion on the Magnificent Seven,” explained Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer of Roundhill in an interview with etf.com about the new launches.

The launch follows the November conversion of Roundhill's BIGT fund into the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which has not had a day of outflows so far this year, pulling in $106.2 million while gaining 13%, according to etf.com data.

While MAGS is for investors, MAGX and MAGQ is for traders, Mazza said.

“Particularly the 2x version is only appropriate for traders who have the ability to monitor their positions on a daily basis,” explained Mazza.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"""So with that as a backdrop, I’d like to highlight some of the progress we’ve made within the quarter. In partnership with NVIDIA, we launched our generative AI service at the end of the quarter. The service is truly unique and addresses fundamental customer needs. Our model is trained solely with Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) best-in-class content, addressing the legal risk that is pervasive in many other models that are trained with third-party intellectual property scraped from the web. We also believe this equates to higher quality outputs as a cake is only as good as its ingredients. With generative AI by Getty Images, users can be confident that the content they generate is safe to use in commercial settings and will not include any trademark brands, products, characters, or identifiable people. It also does not produce deep takes or emulate the style of specific orders, which we believe is valued by our editorial and creative customers respectively. We are rewarding our contributors with an ongoing share of each and every dollar we earn from the service. Last but certainly not least, the service and all of its outputs come with Getty Images uncapped indemnification. In terms of the economics, customers pay to generate versus download, which better aligns to our costs and recognize the value of ideation. Initial customer feedback and engagement with the service has been really positive and we have already introduced new features to the service such as being able to prompt in over 70 languages. And we’re engaged with a limited set of customers to custom-train models to their IP and brand needs.""

Baron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“In the most recently reported quarter, business results for Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), a REIT that is the world’s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, were mildly disappointing as occupancy trends and rents moderated as a result of less housing-related movement and a more price-sensitive consumer. We decided to sell our position because we believe near-term rent and overall cash-flow growth may remain subdued. We are likely to revisit Public Storage in the future.”

7. DigitalBridge Group Inc (NYSE:DBRG)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 31

A caller recently asked Jim Cramer about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG), which he said was once a REIT but later transformed into a ""profitable global alternative asset manager.""

Ave Maria Focused Fund made the following comment about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) started its life with particularly complicated financials as the two data center businesses it owned directly obfuscated the economics of its asset management business. However, DigitalBridge plans to divest enough of their ownership in these two businesses that they will no longer be required to consolidate them in their reported financials. Consequently, its reported financials will be much simpler to analyze and reflect the profile of a pure-play alternative asset manager. DigitalBridge differentiates itself by focusing exclusively on digital infrastructure, an asset class that institutional allocators are severely under allocated to. DigitalBridge is actively fundraising for its third flagship investment fund. With an expected 11-year fund life, this fund could generate fees for the company and its investors for a long time.

6. Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 44

Jim Cramer was recently asked about Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during his ""Lightning Round"" program on CNBC. Cramer said Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is one of his ""absolute favorite stocks."" Jim Cramer said that there's ""such a fantastic narrative there.""

Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Most of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: • Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare’s platform: “And so we’re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass… that comes through in a lot of customer examples…. people want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that’s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.”

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 10

Cramer has long been a believer of best of breed stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and he believes when there's a first-grade, top quality player available in any industry it should be given preference instead of buying other smaller players.

8. C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15

Jim Cramer has said in the past that there's too much hype around the shares of C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI). Earlier this month he was yet again asked about the stock. Cramer said he does not see ""any earnings"" there and he cannot recommend a stock ""that has no earnings.""

However, Cramer praised C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI) CEO Thomas Siebel and said he's a ""bankable guy"" and he's known Siebel for 30 years.

To ride the AI wave Cramer recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Bireme Capital stated the following regarding C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Our final new short position is in a company called C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). Originally named “C3 Energy,” C3.ai has changed its name multiple times based on whatever hot new trend they were supposedly capitalizing on. The “energy” theme was about smart grid and cap-and-trade. Then the firm changed its name to “C3 IoT” to attempt to capitalize on the Internet of Things buzz. After that trend fizzled out, the moniker was altered once more, with the company capturing the “AI” ticker in December 2020 – a savvy move if it wants to sell stock to credulous investors, but irrelevant to its business prospects. As Kerrisdale put it, the company is a “minor, cash burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company.”

7. Cal-Maine Foods Inc (NASDAQ:CALM)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 19

Jim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Mississippi-based fresh eggs producer Cal-Maine Foods Inc (NASDAQ:CALM). Cramer said it's an ""unnecessary stock to own."" Cramer however said he does like Tyson Foods from a valuation perspective.

The dividend-paying company missed fiscal Q2 estimates when it posted earnings in January. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $0.35, missing estimates by $0.48. Revenue in the quarter fell 34.7% year over year to $523.23 million, missing estimates by $2.16 million

Diamond Hill Small Cap Fund made the following comment about Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“On an individual holdings’ basis, top contributors to return in Q3 included Civitas Resources and Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM). Fresh egg producer Cal-Maine Foods has positioned itself well to capitalize on the growing trend toward cage-free and specialty eggs. In May, the US Supreme Court upheld Proposition 12, whereby California can dictate only cage-free eggs be sold in the state — an outcome which will likely open the door for other states to either institute or maintain similar mandates, and which should drive increased long-term demand for Cal-Maine Foods’ eggs.”

6. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22

Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from. Last month Cramer said he was taking a ""hard pass"" on the stock. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) shares are however up about 4.4% year to date through February 25.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds out of the 933 funds had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The most notable stakeholder of Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) was Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $175 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).

Instead of SGRY, Cramer is recommending big stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”

AAPL,2025-04-22,"And as we've seen through major stock performance in 2024, seems like investors are impressed. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's shares are up by 7.64%, 35%, 13%, and 49.7%, year to date, respectively. This shows that even though small cap stocks that are often touted for their ability to deliver double digit and higher percentage returns, major stocks the likes of some of the magnificent seven that we've talked about above can also stun everyone given the market and economic contexts align in their favor.

Before we head on to the best major stocks to buy, another big news for these stocks this year has come from Meta. Meta has traditionally been a high growth technology company whose income statement for years was a classic example of a venture capital model that saw negative profits but revenue growth. Yet in 2024 Meta declared a 50 cent dividend for the first time in its history to mark its entry into the list of stable big guns that can regularly pay out their profits to investors as a reward for patience and belief.

So, as major stocks continue to shine, which ones are hedge funds interested in? We took a look and some notable picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

Our Methodology

To make our list of the best major stocks to buy, we made a list of the common top constituents of the S&P 500 index and the NASDAQ 100 index and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of Q4 2023 end. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen as the best major stocks to buy.

For these best major stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks

16 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Analysts",0.1616398225957049,0.3769936436112905,Positive,0.9968796968460084,0.5220569694204473
AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this piece, we will take a look at Ken Fisher's latest investment portfolio and the 12 biggest positions. If you want to skip our overview of Fisher, his investment firm, and the broader U.S. stock market and macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at Ken Fisher Portfolio: 5 Biggest Positions.

Ken Fisher is one of the richest people in the world courtesy of his hedge fund Fisher Asset Management. The fund had $203 billion in investments spread across its portfolio according to filings with the SEC. Fisher set up his hedge fund nearly five decades ago in 1979 and served as its CEO until 2016 before relinquishing the role. Right now, he's the Executive Chairman of Fisher Investments and holds the title of co-chief investment officer along with Jeff Silk.

A $203 billion investment portfolio is no small achievement, even if the highly risky nature of the hedge fund industry sees the biggest players such as Ken Griffin's Citadel and Seth Klarman's Baupost often take leverage to fund their bets and double their returns. Investment portfolios of this size mean that not only do Fisher Investment's clients have to trust the firm, but also that the hedge fund has to demonstrate that it is able to outperform either the market or the economy or at least serve as a buffer against sharp capital depreciation during times of economic turmoil.

The start of the year is the tone setting mood for stock markets, and for Fisher Investments, the year did not miss out on a beat after the firm had to jump in to release an unusual press release. This press release countered a report by the Wall Street Journal that had stated that Ken Fisher's firm, over which he holds 100% control through a trust that he shares with his wife, was being sold to the Boston, Massachusetts based private equity firm Advent International. The WSJ was not the only publication that cited anonymous sources for its report, as Bloomberg also published a similar piece which outlined that Advent had had talks to ""acquire billionaire Ken Fisher's eponymous Fisher Investments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter"" but also went on to quote Fisher Investment's response that bluntly denied any such speculation.

In fact Fisher's firm, which is quite widely covered in the press and is known for its founder's ability to generate buzz, was quite hard hitting its response. Its press release bluntly stated:

Fisher Investments is not being bought by Advent International, or anyone else—plain and simple.

The WSJ's coverage had speculated that not only was Advent having 'talks' to acquire Fisher Investments, but that the hedge fund might see other partners emerge for a deal. Reading Fisher's press release, while it did deny that a transaction was not officially underway, the text nevertheless missed out on sharing any details of potential 'talks' - leading to the assumption that since there were no talks for a potential sale, there was no need to deny them in the press release.

Moving forward to other news in 2024, the year has started off by providing investors with the latest data set to read the tea leaves and see where the Federal Reserve's current interest rate hiking cycle will be at the year's close. This data set is the retail sales for January which showed an 0.8% annual drop that came as part of a release that saw the Commerce Department also revise down the data for December.

On the surface, this data paints a softer picture of the economy that shows that as consumers face the pinch of high interest rates, they are starting to cut down their spending. However, economists also preached caution after the release, as they speculated that while it is possible that a spending, and by extension economic, slump had led to the sales falling, the contribution of cold temperatures across the U.S. could not be completely ignored in the aftermath of the release.

However, and as has been the case for more than a year now, the optimistic data set was followed by the exact opposite just a day later. On Friday, data from the Labor Department revealed that import prices jumped by 0.8% in January, which was the high reading since the first quarter of 2022. In short, nearly a two year old record of an inflationary indicator was broken, and perhaps unsurprisingly, when paired by the producer price index (PPI)'s 0.3% jump in January, futures linked to the S&P 500 and other indexes dropped.

With the fourth quarter hedge fund filing season well on its way, we decided to see which stocks Fisher Investments is piling into as the year gets off to a roaring start. Some notable names are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we discuss the 11 cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence industry, go directly to the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit the ground running since last year, and there seems to be no end in sight to it in the near future. The PwC Emerging Technology Survey suggests that after the launch of ChatGPT, more than half of the surveyed companies have introduced generative AI in some form to their business. The AI stocks also performed quite well in 2023 and are still trending in 2024. The Magnificent 7 stocks outperformed the rest of the S&P 493 heavily in the year, and analysts like Goldman Sachs' David Kostin are positive that the gains will continue in 2024. The seven big tech stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which were the top performers of the group, collectively gained around 75% during the previous year compared to 12% gains for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index.

Other than the big tech, AI technology gave a boost to a range of AI companies. The Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (IGPT) gained over 30% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 25% growth. Moreover, the ETF is also 15.80% higher year-to-date (YTD) at the time of the February 23 market close, compared to the S&P 500’s 7.3% gains.

AI is changing the face of every sector in the market. For example, the mortgage finance company Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE:RKT) uses AI for mortgage banking, underwriting, and servicing. In 2023, The company piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers and outbound client calls.

In addition, the real estate company Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) sets up networks and data centers, making it quite exposed to potential growth in AI computer facilities. At the company’s Q4 2023 earnings call CEO Charles Meyers said:

“We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.

Effects of AI on Labor

An International Monetary Fund (IMF) report defines AI as a double-edged sword. While AI can potentially create many jobs, it can also replace human labor in several other areas. The IMF believes that nearly 40% of the jobs around the world are exposed to AI. In the developed countries, 60% of the jobs will be affected by the new technology creating a higher risk/reward situation for their labor markets. However, the report mentions that wealthier countries are also better equipped to adopt AI.

For emerging economies and under-developed nations, the IMF suggests laying concrete groundwork and infrastructure to be better prepared for the AI revolution in the job market.

The artificial intelligence industry is on the rise, and it’s significantly far away from its peak. This creates some entry points for investors in cheap AI companies. Keeping that in mind, some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024 include Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).

11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Analysts

11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 11.40%

Average Analyst Price Target: $196.65

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) takes the 11th spot on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy. It produces semiconductor devices and its products, including AMD Vitis AI platform, MI300, and Ryzen 8040 laptop processors are driven by and designed for AI applications.

34 Wall Street analysts covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) over the last three months, and 29 maintained a Buy rating on the stock. As of the February 23 market close, the average price target of $196.65 represented an upside of 11.40%.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, along with Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.95%

Average Analyst Price Target: $206.15

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131

Mairs & Power mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“The Fund’s relative performance was negatively impacted by what we didn’t own as well. In particular, not holding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for most of the year cost the Fund more than 300bps (basis points) of performance. Apple may be the best-known company in the world and its seemingly ubiquitous iPhone holds a dominant share of the global cell phone market. Apple is even more dominant among Millennials and Gen Zers, which should lead to even greater market share as these cohorts age. This loyal user base should pay huge dividends for shareholders as Apple continues to monetize this ecosystem, especially as the company delves deeper into services, payments, and AI. We initiated a position in Apple during the fourth quarter and await a more attractive entry point to add to our position.”

9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.33%

Average Analyst Price Target: $164.59

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 214

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest tech holding companies and has many AI-driven products under its belt, including Bard, Gemini 1.5, and more.

On February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) introduced its new next-generation AI model, named Gemini 1.5. The mid-size multimodal model is set to be released for testing soon and will be called the Gemini 1.5 Pro version.

According to Insider Monkey’s database which tracks 933 elite hedge funds, 214 funds had investments in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock in the fourth quarter. With 45.22 million shares worth $6.3 billion, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management was the top investor in the company.

First Pacific Advisors stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”

8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.44%

Average Analyst Price Target: $469.58

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 302

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been long making headlines in the AI industry with its investments in AI companies and AI products like Azure AI.

On February 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith took to Twitter and announced that the company would be investing $2.1 billion over the next two years to develop the AI infrastructure in Spain.

On February 15, it was reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning on furthering the AI infrastructure in Germany through an investment of 3.2 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in the next two years.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was mentioned in Baron Funds’ fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Our biggest purchase in the fourth quarter was a new position we initiated in the software platform Microsoft Corporation. While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund, we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy. However, Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric, on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers. Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly. Over time, Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share, while becoming a more important driver for the company. For example, in the last quarterly earnings release, Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors. A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year. Just to put this in perspective, $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business, it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue. We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner, global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $4.7 trillion worldwide IT spending.

7. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 17.66%

Average Analyst Price Target: $122.30

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20

Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a California-based company that designs and sells user interface solutions, and many of them are integrated with AI, like its Smart Home SoC solution. It ranks seventh on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.

On February 9, Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy raised the price target on Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)’s stock to $130 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.

On February 8, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) released its Q2 earnings result with a non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, which beat the estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $237 million topped the estimates by $1.33 million.

TimesSquare Capital Management made the following comment about Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:

“In the Information Technology sector, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) develops and markets semiconductor product solutions. Their products enable users to interact more easily with smartphones, notebooks, tablets, and other portable multi-media devices. While the fiscal third quarter results were in line with sell-side projections, forward guidance was worse than expected. Management sees growing macroeconomic headwinds further impacting IT budgets, and the inventory draw-down has been slower than they had anticipated on weaker sell-through trends. Synaptics lost -23% and we added to the position.”

6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 18.07%

Average Analyst Price Target: $653.43

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a California-based company that manufactures and sells computer software and its Adobe Sensei is just one feather among many in its hat when it comes to AI technology.

In the fourth quarter, 105 hedge funds owned a stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s stock. Fisher Asset Management was the most significant stakeholder in the company, with 4.56 million shares worth $2.72 billion, representing 1.33% of the portfolio.

Out of 30 Wall Street analysts that covered Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the last three months, 24 kept a Buy rating on the stock. The average price target of $653.43 had an upside of 18.07% as of the February 23 market close.

Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) are some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, besides Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).

Polen Capital commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best magic formula stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our coverage of what magic formula investing is all about, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now.

Considering the thousands of companies that trade on stock markets such as the NASDAQ and the NYSE as well as the plethora of information that investors are bombarded with every day, investing sometimes appears as nothing short of wizardry. For novices, terms such as relative strength indexes (RSIs), standard deviations of returns, beta, earnings per share, yields, and other metrics appear to be a new language that requires a detailed study before one can become comfortable with it.

One investor who literally describes his investment strategy as 'magic' is Joel Greenblatt. Mr. Greenblatt is the chief investment officer of the ominously named Gotham Asset Management. While his investment decisions focus mostly on making returns for investors rather than fighting crime, Mr. Greenblatt's approach has nevertheless won him more fame in financial markets than Bruce Wayne. He set up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, which makes the fund relatively younger when compared to some other funds that have been around for decades.

However, before Gotham Asset Management, the Magic Formula investor was at the helm of the fund Gotham Capital. He set up Gotham Capital in 1985, and the fund successfully focused on investing in distressed or 'special situation' companies and stocks. These stocks are of firms that might be facing troubles in managing their debt, or they might be struggling in their markets due to choices made of their own accord or broader macroeconomic factors. Mr. Greenblatt's Gotham Capital was one of the top performing funds in its league back in the mid 80s and 90s as it delivered net 30% returns during the time periods.

Like some other hedge fund and investing heavyweights like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, Mr. Greenblatt is also an adherent of one of Wall Street's best known investment approaches. If you haven't guessed it already, this approach is called Value Investing. Value investing simply analyzes a stock to compute what the investor believes is a fair value of the shares. This value is then compared to the market price of the stock, and if it's higher than the market price, then a potential investment decision is made. This investment decision is also influenced by the difference between fair and market values. The higher this difference is, the more comfortable an investor is buying the shares as it leaves a greater 'margin of safety' for non fundamental downward share price movements.

So where's the magic? Well, Mr. Greenblatt's flavor of value investing is called Magic Formula investing. This strategy is based on the two fundamental metrics of share price and stock valuation. These are the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. For the uninitiated, the ROCE divides a firm's operating income by the sum of its working capital and net fixed assets. The logic behind this computation is that the ROCE measures the return to investors over the costs of doing business as measured by buying and selling inventory and spending on assets. The earnings yield of a stock is its earnings per share divided by the share price, and it enables investors to understand the true post expenses, tax, and interest ability of their investment to make money.

In Magic Formula investing, the ROCE and earnings yield of stocks are calculated first. They are then ranked according to these metrics, and the top shares are bought and held for the long term to benefit from a firm's ability to capitalize on its assets and cash to turn a profit and return for investors.

So what are some magic formula stocks that can deliver magical returns? We took a look today, and some top stock picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW).

Markets wavered as latest data showed inflation in January 2024 was hotter-than-expected. But many analysts believe the markets overreacted as a single month's data can only delay the Fed's planned rate cuts for 2024. UBS Global Wealth Management on February 20 said it expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in June instead of May. UBS expects the first rate cut to be of 25 basis points.

""Given the upside surprises to both payrolls and inflation, we now expect the Fed to wait a bit longer before cutting rates,"" UBS economists said in a note.

UBS is expecting 75 bps of cuts in 2024, lower than its previous estimate of 100 bps cuts.

The era of elevated interest rates might be prolonged amid a resilient labor market and stubborn inflation but sooner or later the Fed will begin to cut rates. That means good times might be coming for small-cap stocks or risky equities, including penny stocks, which have hitherto suffered as investors' shunned smaller companies to find refuge in high quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Historical data showed small-cap stocks perform exceptionally well in the first 12 months of the Fed's first rate cut.

Lord Abbett in its December 2023 report took a detailed look at what the private investment management company called a dovish ""pivot"" of the Federal Reserve where it hinted that its interest rate cycle might have peaked. The Lord Abbett report also said small-cap companies perform well during rate cuts.

""Currently, in fixed income, we find the short duration space to be attractive and underallocated. A “bull-steepening” environment, like what we’ve seen when the Fed turns dovish on policy, favors short duration. At the same time, the normalized rate environment can make active, opportunistic credit an attractive diversifier with expected returns at current yields rivaling equities. Equities, particularly small caps, historically have done very well when inflation falls and in Fed rate-cut cycles while growth equities have done well when growth slows. Finally, a more normalized rate environment means less of the “financing for everyone” that was prevalent in the zero-interest-rate era. Going forward, quality companies with greater financial strength should be able to differentiate in terms of financial performance and demand a premium. All in all, the Fed’s dovish December pivot shocked the markets and set the table for better performance by risk assets in 2024. What a difference a week can make,"" the report added.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best gold mining stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our overview of the latest trends in the world of gold and minerals, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Gold Mining Companies to Invest In According to Analysts.

Gold serves as a safe-haven investment, sought by investors to mitigate risks associated with factors like inflation, geopolitical tensions, and financial instability. These variables often contribute to gold price volatility, as witnessed in 2022 and early 2023. Gold surged to over $2,000 per ounce during this period due to concerns regarding inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. However, the market experienced significant price fluctuations as investors evaluated the possibility of a recession against the backdrop of increasing interest rates, inflation, and other dynamics.

A Bloomberg report released earlier in 2023 unveiled a notable trend among global sovereign wealth funds and investors toward accumulating gold. Invesco's analysis was based on a survey encompassing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks, collectively managing assets totaling around $21 trillion. The report underscored the sentiment surrounding gold, noting that ""a significant portion of central banks express concerns about the precedent set by the US freezing of Russian reserves, with the majority (58%) agreeing that this event has heightened the appeal of gold."" The survey findings underscored gold's enduring role as an inflation hedge, with a considerable number of central banks indicating intentions to bolster their gold reserves over the next three years.

Amidst forecasts of persistent upward trends in gold prices fueled by geopolitical tensions and uncertainties, Netherlands-based ING Group predicts a continuation of the surge witnessed in 2023 into 2024. The initial surge in gold prices followed the outbreak of conflict in Israel earlier in the year, and despite tensions easing, prices have remained high. ING Group anticipates that the Federal Reserve will begin reducing interest rates in May 2024, with a total expected reduction of 150 basis points throughout the year, and an additional 100 basis points in early 2025. These rate cuts are forecasted to bolster gold prices in 2024.",0.1864,0.3956,Positive,0.6305067539215088,0.4458539694742251

The US stock market's euphoria came crashing down recently when latest data showed inflation remains sticky and the soft landing scenario many had started to take as a given might not be easy to achieve. Ever since the inflation storm began, wise investors had been recommending piling into recession-proof, high-quality blue chip stocks that can weather economic volatility. While a single month's bad inflation numbers do not mean doom and gloom for the stock market, many analysts believe we are in for a long period of inflation and risks where low-quality stocks should be completely avoided. Russell Investments in its 2024 outlook report said that while recession was avoided in 2023, risks in 2024 are high because the consumer savings that protected Americans from recession last year are expected to be exhausted this year.

""Corporations and households built strong defenses against Fed tightening following the pandemic, accumulating large cash reserves and locking in low interest rates on 30-year mortgages and longer-term corporate bonds. These defenses, however, are beginning to crumble. Households will soon exhaust their excess savings, while significantly higher interest rates—which have become a constraint on new borrowing—will create refinancing issues. We think this cycle may be a case of this time is longer rather than this time is different with regards to the lagged impact of aggressive Fed tightening on the U.S. economy. Recession in 2024 might be avoided, but the risks are elevated.""

In this environment it's important to see which blue chip stocks smart money investors are piling into.

Jim Cramer earlier this week talked about ""froth"" in the market which he believes could be a ""bummer"" albeit ""enjoyable"" at the same time. Cramer said that while the market has been up for 14 out of the last 15 weeks, many circles believe that is not a good development since too much enthusiasm in the market could be a telltale sign of future declines. Jim Cramer gave some examples of what he calls ""exuberance"" in the market. Cramer talked about Arm Holdings' huge stock price gains posted recently. Arm Holdings stock is up about 84% over the past one month. The stock is rising mostly on the back of the AI enthusiasm as investors believe the UK-based semiconductor company could see a huge demand for its chips just like Nvidia.

Cramer Talks About Market ""Froth"" and Lack of Discipline

But these gains are just too much for Cramer, who yelled ""give me a break"" when talking about Arm Holdings. Cramer said most of the people buying ARM have no idea what they are doing and said they ""just have no discipline.""

Cramer also said that the NASDAQ is currently going through a ""parabolic rally"" and such rallies are ""never sustainable.""

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we discuss 12 best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ’s performance, head over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.

In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.

The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.

The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.

Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.

To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”

10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11.

“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.

9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 134

Bireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”

6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in. On January 30, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported its fourth quarter results.

The S&P 500 closed above 5,000 points for the first time, as investors continued piling into the artificial intelligence and other technology companies that have pushed the index higher, betting those stocks have fuel in the tank for future runs.

The index has gained 5.4% this year, adding to last year's 28% jump. The $486.6 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), the largest exchange-traded fund, closed above $500 for the first time, finishing the day at $501.16.

The S&P 500 rose 0.6% today to close at 5026.61. It first traded above 5,000 on Thursday, Feb. 8 before backing down.

Amid a variety of potentially bad economic and global news, including interest rate cut delays, budget battles, and political uncertainty in the U.S., investors have still bet on rising technology stocks and continued consumer spending. Meanwhile, unemployment is down, price inflation has been dropping from historic highs, and wages and consumer confidence are up.

“5,000 might just be an arbitrary round number, but it's exciting for investors to see after a two-year bear market,” said etf.com analyst Sumit Roy.

Better than expected tech earnings from companies such as Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc., and Amazon.com, Inc. in recent days drove the index higher and helped turn around a beginning-of-the-year slump in stocks. The broad index, which captures exposure to many of the largest U.S.-based corporations, is up 4.8% this year so far and 11% in the past six months, largely driven by a few high-flying tech socks referred to as the Magnificent 7.

A Feb. 2 jobs report offered more positive news for investors pushing the stock market higher. The January report showed unemployment lowering and wage increases for many workers.

The index covered the last 1,000 points in an almost three-year roller-coaster ride, having hit 4,000 in April 2021.

Top issuers have their own funds that offer exposure to the S&P 500, which is considered to be a broad barometer of the market. Other S&P 500 ETFs include the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO).

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best FAANG stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.

From FAANG to the Magnificent 7 and Beyond

The technology sector has been on a steady rise for quite a while now, and the most obvious answer to the industry's propulsion to greater and greater heights is the ongoing obsession with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Many within the AI space today are large tech companies, such as the FAANG names. These days, however, a new moniker has been on the rise to identify the best tech companies of the day: the Magnificent Seven.

The original cohort of tech names to keep an eye on included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), all coming together to form the FAANG group. Today, these companies are challenged by several others in the market, particularly semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA isn't alone either, and so the original list of FAANG stocks has had to accommodate the rise of new and old mega-tech companies bolstered by the emergence of AI.

Regardless of what you call these companies or who joins these new exciting groups, the fact remains that the tech sector has been abuzz with news of innovations, rising investments, and higher profitability. At the end of the day, it's starting to look like tech companies really are starting to rule the world.

The Three AI Amigos

On February 8, Gene Munster, the managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss recent trends in the tech sector and the rise of FAANG stocks, particularly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here's what he had to say:

""They have the biggest upside potential relative to where expectations are... these three, I think, are largely unappreciated. I just wanna start with Meta. I think it's the biggest AI opportunity that's misunderstood. Most investors understand that Meta is using AI to improve ad campaigns, ad attribution... but there is a significant underappreciated lever that could take this into a whole different atmosphere. This theory comes from Deepwater's Doug Clinton. He believes that ultimately, they will monetize Llama. Llama is an opensource model. The other foundation models, Claude, and ChatGPT, and Gemini, they're all closed. Llama has 30 million downloads. If they monetize this, they will likely announce a cloud infrastructure... that is a whole new shift, and new benefit to Meta.""

On the rise of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, Munster said the following:

""Apple's gonna come out with their own foundation model likely in June, and they're gonna allow this to do personalized AI. This is really gonna capture 20% of the world's interest, and they can charge $10 a month for this.""

Most investors have been overlooking Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, but Munster thinks the company is on its way to benefitting from a new opportunity.

Biden Administration's Investment in Chips

In an additional boost for the tech sector, the Biden Administration has announced a $5 billion investment in chips, a move that is bound to uplift the semiconductor industry. On February 9, Ronnie Chatterji, professor at Duke University and former White House Chips Coordinator, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss this move. He noted that this move signals a partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure that the US continues to lead ""in the current generation of chips"" alongside the ""next generation."" The investment is thus being welcomed overwhelmingly and may signal greater things for semiconductor companies in 2024.

With the current situation being so overwhelmingly in favor of tech companies, we have compiled a list of the best FAANG stocks to buy now. These include some of the top American tech stocks to buy apart from the original FAANG stocks.

10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported its fourth earnings last week. Although slumping demand for smartphones didn’t bring down its earnings, weak demand in China overshadowed its first sales growth in a year that came as a result of record service revenue. In addition, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) dethroned Apple as the world’s most valuable company in January as it hit the $3 trillion market capitalization while Apple’s slipped below this milestone. Microsoft also reported its strongest profit growth in more than two years as it continues to infuse AI across its business and offerings.

Fourth Quarter Highlights

Apple posted revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $117.91 billion. Apple also reported record earnings per share of $2.18, also topping $2.11 that analysts had predicted. Net income rose 13% to $34 billion.

Net iPhone sales grew almost 6% YoY to $69.7 billion while global iPad sales dropped to $7 billion, down from $9 billion reported for 2022’s comparable quarter.

While sales in Europe and Japan rose, revenue in China slumped 13% YoY to $20.8 billion. Demand in China has slowed more than expected in response to rising competition from Huawei as well as Beijing restriction on its products. According to Counterpoint Research, overall China smartphone sales grew 6.6% and although Apple maintained its leadership with 20.2% market share, its sales dropped 9% while Huawei experienced a sales rise of as much as 71%.

But the services segment that houses its App Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple TV, continues to be a rising star as its revenue grew 11% YoY to 23.1 billion.

The iPhone might no longer be the best indicator of Apple’s health...

Services were undoubtedly the star of the latest quarterly report that came one day after Apple’s biggest product launch in about a decade- the Vision Pro headset. Priced at $3,499, Apple spent an estimated $100 billion to develop this product it hopes to become the must-have piece of home electronics. More importantly, this product is the ultimate opportunity for Tim Cook to make his own Apple legacy.

Moreover, Apple splurged on its AppleTV+ content and it has scored it as many as 13 Academy Award nominations, with ten of them being for the Killers of The Flower Moon. But, this is kind of expected as Apple built its biggest movie industry bet with the all-time-great director, screenwriter and producer, Mr. Martin Scorsese.

Apple posted strong numbers and it showed that services continue to grow and become a bigger part of the tech giant’s business, but China is a lingering concern. In response to this slowdown in China, Apple even offered a rare discount for its latest iPhone in January. Cook also confirmed that generative AI software features are coming on Apple’s iOS and other platforms later this year, which is only to be expected considering that Microsoft, Google and Samsung’s latest figures were fueled by such enhancements. But considering that Apple is known for being secretive about its next moves, Cook’s confirmation and tease could mean that Apple’s AI plans are ambitious, to say the least. After all, there’s nothing artificial about AI and generative AI’s business potential nor the the latest figures that Microsoft and Google posted, and this is just the beginning of a new era that is in the making.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we discuss 10 best augmented reality stocks under $5. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the augmented reality industry, head directly to 5 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5.

Augmented reality technology is found in broad applications within entertainment, training, brand engagement, augmented surgeries, virtual tours, and quality control, among others. Small and medium-sized enterprises are increasingly adopting this technology to improve customer experiences and stay competitive in the market. Industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, retail, gaming, education, and automotive are actively embracing AR for training, maintenance, assistance, and monitoring purposes. The augmented reality market is expected to grow due to increased smartphone adoption and app integration, according to Fortune Business Insights. Moreover, key market players collaborating with 5G providers to address latency issues are anticipated to drive market growth. For example, in May 2022, Telstra Group Limited (ASX:TLS), an Australian telecommunications company, partnered with Google and Accenture to create a 5G-powered augmented reality experience at Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium. Such collaborations among major tech providers are likely to enhance the potential of AR in diverse innovative and immersive applications.

The AR market was valued at $42.20 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach $1.11 trillion by 2030, exhibiting a 50.7% compound annual growth rate. In 2022, the North American augmented reality market was valued at $13.72 billion. Key industry players like PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) offer different AR solutions. For instance, PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) provides products like Vuforia AR, Vuforia Studio, Vuforia Expert Capture, Vuforia Instruct, and Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, while Google LLC offers ARCore, an AR platform featuring cloud anchors, environmental HDR, and depth for digital objects.

In 2023, we witnessed the launch of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro, alongside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s premium VR device, targeted either as a creative tool or a luxury item due to its high price. This year might unveil Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s anticipated AR glasses. Different devices, like the Apple Glasses and Meta Quest Pro, will strive to offer unique experiences. Some will emphasize a sophisticated high-end encounter, while others will prioritize lightweight and simplicity, understanding that current headset sizes and weights deter adoption for many users. Online platforms enabling remote teamwork will evolve in 2024, aiming for increased immersion and practicality. Despite the popularity of remote work, certain aspects of in-person communication are challenging to replicate. Collaborative mixed reality tools are expected to utilize VR and AR more extensively, capturing and expressing the subtle nuances of interaction that are difficult to convey through video calls.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Tim Cook unveiled the ""Vision Pro,"" an augmented reality headset, during the WWDC event in June 2023. According to Cook, it represents a new kind of computer that enhances user experience through the most natural and intuitive methods. He likened its significance to the introduction of previous Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, suggesting that just as the Mac brought personal computing and the iPhone brought mobile computing, the Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing. The Vision Pro marks Apple's entry into a significant new product category, the first since 2015. Priced at $3,499, this headset seamlessly combines virtual and augmented reality. Historically, this market has been somewhat specialized, with Meta holding a dominant position. However, Apple aims to leverage advanced technology and its renowned marketing skills to elevate this sector. During the launch event at Apple's New York store, CEO Tim Cook highlighted the device's impressive interface, describing it as a ""magical way to control"" the headset. The Vision Pro utilizes eye movement and hand gestures for navigation, offering users immersive experiences. Cook draws parallels between the Vision Pro's debut and the launches of other iconic Apple devices, such as the Mac, iPod, and iPhone, emphasizing that it now stands among the groundbreaking products in Apple's history.

New entrants are creating a buzz in the augmented reality space. For example, Xreal, a maker of augmented reality glasses, is in the process of raising $60 million in funding, bringing its total funding to over $300 million and valuing the company at more than $1 billion. The CEO, Chi Xu, aims to stay ahead of competitors like Apple, Meta Platforms, and Google in the augmented reality space. Xreal, a Chinese startup, holds approximately 4% of the overall mixed reality market, with a significant presence in the AR-only devices sector. The funds will support the production of 2 million devices next year, with a target of going public in the United States within the next two years. The company anticipates generating $100 million to $150 million in revenue in 2024 and between $200 million and $300 million in 2025.

Although the augmented reality market is dominated by tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), we discuss AR stocks under $5 in this article.

Apple beats AliveCor antitrust lawsuit over heart-rate apps for Apple Watch

In This Article:

(Reuters) — Apple has persuaded a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit by a Silicon Valley startup accusing it of illegally monopolizing the US market for heart rate monitoring apps for its Apple Watch.

US District Judge Jeffrey White in Oakland, California, ruled on Tuesday against AliveCor, which had developed an app for detecting irregular heartbeats.

It had accused Apple of violating the federal Sherman antitrust law and a California unfair competition law.

The decision explaining White's reasoning is temporarily being kept under seal because of confidentiality concerns.

""AliveCor is deeply disappointed and strongly disagrees with the court's decision to dismiss our anti-competition case and we plan to appeal,"" the company said in a statement.

Apple said in a statement that the lawsuit challenged its ability to make improvements to the Apple Watch that consumers and developers rely on. ""Today's outcome confirms that is not anticompetitive,"" it said.

In an amended complaint, AliveCor said Apple had led it to believe it would collaborate on heart-monitoring technology for the Apple Watch, only to then copy its ideas and embark on a ""concentrated campaign to corner the market for heartrate analysis.""

The complaint also accused Apple of ""updating"" the heartrate algorithm for its watches, to prevent third parties from identifying irregular heartbeats and offering competing apps.

AliveCor had developed KardiaBand, a wristband for the Apple Watch capable of recording an electrocardiogram, or ECG.

The Mountain View, California-based company also developed the Kardia app for analyzing ECG readings on Apple Watches, and a SmartRhythm heartrate analysis app powered by artificial intelligence.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, has denied wrongdoing, and said competitors have no right to dictate its design decisions.

AliveCor is still litigating separate patent infringement claims against Apple.

The case is AliveCor Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 21-03958.

These companies are some of the best long-term tech stocks to invest in and have been dubbed the best tech stocks to buy for several years, all due to their stellar performance. But they have been joined by many other notable names, which our list below will highlight.

Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts

Upslope Capital Management mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”

Gates bought approximately 52,815 shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the third quarter. The Microsoft co-founder joined the Apple bandwagon relatively late, as many billionaires already have significant exposure to the tech giant. Warren Buffett, one of the most influential investors of this generation, considers Apple to be one of his crown jewels, claiming the business is ""better than anything we own.""

Buffett has a 5.9% stake in Apple as he owns over 915 million shares, making it his largest portfolio holding. He last bought Apple shares in the first quarter of 2023.

Fisher increased his stake in Apple in the third quarter, scooping up over 878,000 shares. Apple is the largest holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 5.25% of its total portfolio.

Concerns regarding slowing demand for Apple's products have caused the stock to plummet this year. Given concerns regarding Apple's sales in China amid tensions between the U.S. and China, the tech giant has been strategically shifting its production base to India. The company aims to produce nearly 25% of its iPhones in the Southeast Asian country.

Bank of America upgraded Apple stock to Buy on Jan. 18, issuing a price target of $225. This indicates a potential upside of over 17%.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"The U.S. stock market rallied in 2023 despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive stance and concerns regarding an impending recession and growing geopolitical tensions. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index surged by over 43% in fiscal 2023, marking its best year since 2020. The broader S&P 500 index rose 24.2% last year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 14%. The Canadian S&P/TSX Exchange rose by nearly 8% last year.

The U.S. and Canadian equity markets' stellar performance, despite all odds, proved to be highly unprofitable for short sellers, who were betting on stocks to fall. According to S3 Partners Research, short sellers faced an ""exceedingly difficult year"" in 2023, losing approximately $194.9 billion. Bearish traders had a total short position of $957 billion in 2023, according to S3 Partners.

Banking Crisis

The U.S. regional banking crisis in early 2023, triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, was one of the most profitable periods for short sellers. Short sellers booked a profit of 840%, or $1.6 billion, on their bet against First Republic Bank, making it the most profitable bet placed by short sellers last.

The collapse of First Republic Bank marked the largest banking failure since 2008 and the second-largest in history. The bank was subsequently acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). Short interest increased tremendously during the height of the banking crisis, as short interest in First Republic increased to the range of between 7% and 37% by March 31, significantly above the average of between 3% and 5% for U.S. equities.

Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was the second-most profitable investment bet made by short-sellers last year, while Signature Bank was the 11th most profitable.

“The shorts in the months before the collapse were accurately warning the markets...that the bank (SVB) was being dangerously mismanaged,” Better Markets President and CEO Dennis Kelleher wrote in an email to Reuters. “The problem is once that collapse happened, shorts with various motives started targeting other banks.”

Tech Rally Of 2023

Tech stocks, which witnessed a substantial rout in 2022, made a surprising comeback last year, catching short sellers off guard. Artificial intelligence (AI) was the game changer driving tech stocks last year, as Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI launched the viral generative AI platform ChatGPT, while chip maker Nvidia Corp.'s AI-focused chips gained traction.

The six major stocks that faced setbacks for short sellers, according to S3 Research Partners, include Tesla Inc., Nvidia, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc.

Short sellers lost the most money betting against Tesla, booking a collective loss of $12.2 billion in 2023. Short sellers lost more money on their Tesla bet than any other company last year, as the stock surged by nearly 102%. This is in stark contrast with 2022 when short sellers booked a net profit of over $15 billion as Tesla slumped by approximately 65% in fiscal 2022.

Trends In 2024

So far, 2024 has been tumultuous for the U.S. stock market, as equities have been fluctuating because of concerns regarding the timeline of interest rate cuts that the Federal Reserve signaled in December.

However, the benchmark indexes have ended in the green as of Jan. 27, with the S&P 500 index gaining over 2.5% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite index, on the other hand, has fared slightly better so far this year and is up nearly 3%. The DJIA index logged 1.1% gains over the same period.

The Magnificent Seven stocks plummeted during the first trading week of 2024, driving bearish short sellers to book nearly $4 billion in gains as of Jan. 10.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a global leader in technology, released its 10-Q filing on February 2, 2024, revealing the company's financial performance for the quarter ended December 30, 2023. The filing indicates a solid financial position, with net sales amounting to $119.575 billion, a slight increase from the previous year's $117.154 billion. The company's net income saw a notable rise to $33.916 billion from $29.998 billion, showcasing Apple's ability to maintain profitability amidst a competitive landscape. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the recent SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of Apple Inc's strategic positioning.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CHTR.

Strengths

Financial Resilience and Product Dominance: Apple's financial health remains robust, with an increase in net income to $33.916 billion, up from $29.998 billion in the previous year. This financial resilience is underpinned by the iPhone's continued dominance in the market, contributing significantly to the company's revenue. Apple's ability to maintain high-profit margins, particularly in its services segment, which saw an 11% increase in net sales, further solidifies its financial strength. The company's diversified product portfolio, including the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, complements the iPhone ecosystem, creating a comprehensive suite of products that drive customer loyalty and recurring revenue.

Innovation and Brand Equity: Apple's commitment to research and development, with expenses maintained at $7.696 billion, underscores its focus on innovation. The company's brand is synonymous with quality and innovation, which is reflected in its strong gross margin of $54.855 billion. Apple's brand equity is a competitive advantage that allows it to command premium pricing and maintain a loyal customer base. The introduction of new products, such as the updated MacBook Pro and iMac, demonstrates Apple's continuous effort to innovate and meet consumer demands.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Key Products: Despite its financial success, Apple's heavy reliance on the iPhone, which accounts for a significant portion of its revenue, poses a risk. Any disruption in the iPhone's market appeal or supply chain could have a substantial impact on the company's overall performance. Additionally, the decrease in iPad sales by 25% indicates potential vulnerabilities in Apple's product mix that need to be addressed to ensure sustained growth.

Supply Chain and Geopolitical Risks: Apple's supply chain is complex and global, with significant exposure to geopolitical risks and trade tensions, particularly in Greater China, where net sales decreased by 13%. The company's reliance on outsourcing partners and individual suppliers for components and manufacturing also presents operational risks that could affect its ability to deliver products efficiently and cost-effectively.

Opportunities

Services and Wearables Expansion: The growth in Apple's services and wearables segments presents significant opportunities. With an 11% increase in services net sales, Apple is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital content, cloud services, and subscription-based models. The wearables market also offers potential for expansion, despite a decrease in sales, as consumer interest in health and fitness technology continues to rise.

International Markets and New Technologies: Apple's performance in international markets, such as a 15% increase in Japan net sales, highlights the opportunity for further geographic expansion. Additionally, the company's investments in new technologies, such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence, could open up new revenue streams and strengthen its competitive position in the long term.

Threats

Competitive Pressure and Market Saturation: The technology industry is highly competitive, with rapid innovation and changing consumer preferences. Apple faces intense competition from other smartphone and technology manufacturers, which could erode its market share and pressure margins. Market saturation, particularly in mature markets, poses a challenge to growth, as most consumers already own smartphones and upgrade cycles lengthen.

Economic Uncertainties and Regulatory Changes: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation and currency fluctuations, can impact consumer spending and Apple's international sales. Regulatory changes, such as those related to privacy and antitrust concerns, could also force Apple to alter its business practices, potentially affecting its profitability and strategic direction.

In conclusion, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) exhibits a strong financial foundation and brand equity, driven by its flagship iPhone and a growing services segment. However, the company must navigate challenges such as product dependence, supply chain complexities, and competitive pressures. Opportunities for expansion in services, wearables, and international markets are countered by threats from market saturation and regulatory changes. Apple's strategic focus on innovation and customer experience positions it to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic tech landscape.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at theHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.

Charles Paquelet is an American hedge fund manager who founded Skylands Capital in 2004. Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:

''Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,"" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.

In 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital.

Charles Paquelet's Investment Philosophy

Skylands Capital's investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to ""extrapolate"" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who ""can anticipate change before it is obvious.""

Value or Growth?

Charles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.

""It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important,"" the fund's website says.

Baron Growth Fund made the following comment about Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a leading mobile voice and data communications services vendor offering global coverage via satellite. Shares fell on second quarter earnings, growth modestly slower than expected. Investors were also concerned by a potential slowdown in Iridium’s voice and data segment following several years during which the segment benefited from price increases and competition displacements. We attribute the earnings miss to a one-time write off of a spare satellite. This will not impact the company’s long-term prospects. We also remain excited about the potential benefit from Iridium’s recent partnership with Qualcomm to allow satellite connectivity on its new Snapdragon chips. While Iridium has suggested the realization of the direct-to-device opportunity might take longer than some investors had hoped, we believe the collaboration will yield substantial revenue for the company over time. We also remain excited about the company’s capital allocation program, which should benefit shareholders in the years ahead.”

7. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,612,316

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top tech stock picks of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet since his hedge fund Skylands Capital has a $2.6 million stake in the ecommerce retailer which is also a part of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that have gained a lot amid the AI boom.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the most popular technology stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 286 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”

“Our bottom contributors in Q3 were all from our long book, including HCA Healthcare and SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC). SS&C Technologies, a provider of software and services to investment firms, brokerages and other financial institutions, has faced slower organic growth in recent quarters as its business units have produced inconsistent results. Further, rising costs have crimped margins — issues we believe will eventually stabilize but which we are monitoring closely. However, we believe the market is overly pessimistic about the company’s ability to improve its organic growth rate and its margins and are maintaining our position.”

Both stocks surged with higher US electricity prices as strong summer demand exposed reliability issues in many regions of the nation’s electric grid. Meanwhile, Midwest focused Constellation is the biggest producer of carbon-free electricity in the US with nuclear power plants representing the majority of its capacity.

Our research identified an upside to earnings power from maturing hedges and regulatory changes, including the Inflation Reduction Act’s nuclear credit. A recent spinout from Exelon Corp, we viewed the strength of Constellation’s clean, reliable baseload power model as an appealing and high potential offering for residential and commercial customers.

Today, we'll take a look at some of the most profitable blue chip stocks right now. Profit is an important indicator of a stock's financial health since it measures the money that is available for growth reinvesting, retained capital, or dividends if the company is a dividend paying stock.

Methodology

For this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26. From these stocks we picked 16 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

16. Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 23

Transportation services company Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In October Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) posted Q3 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $1.71, beating estimates by $0.01.

15. American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 42

With a dividend yield of 2% and a PE ratio of 13, insurance and financial solutions company American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds shows that 42 hedge funds had stakes in American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG).

Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Insurance company American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) was also among our top contributors. The company’s most recent operating results outperformed expectations, as it reported robust earnings with improving underwriting margins in the property and casualty business. AIG’s strategic initiatives also added to the positive sentiment. The company made further progress in separating its Life & Retirement unit by selling additional shares via a secondary offering. Furthermore, AIG announced the sale of its reinsurance business to RenaissanceRe at an attractive valuation, a move that will further reduce volatility in AIG’s continuing operations.”

14. Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 42

Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) is one of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Earlier this month, Wolfe Research upgraded Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) along with some other semiconductor stocks as it becomes ""incrementally more bullish"" on analog circuits.

""We stayed neutral on analog for too long this cycle, since stocks bottomed an unprecedented full year before fundamentals began to deteriorate,"" Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note.

Here is what Weitz Conservative Allocation Fund has to say about Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“We added a new position in Microchip Technology, Inc., (NASDAQ:MCHP) to the Fund during the quarter. Microchip is a leading provider of mixed signal microcontrollers and analog semiconductors to a broad range of industrial, data center, automotive, communication and consumer appliance customers. The company enjoys favorable product characteristics that help drive strong profitability, and it benefits from several long-wave demand tailwinds such as electronification, automation, and growth in data communications. While Microchip is not immune from semiconductor cycles, its cash flows have been durable through cycles. The multi-year outlook is solid, and we think the company is poised to further boost per-share value growth through increasing share repurchases at discounted prices.

13. Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 44

HR and payroll solutions company Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) ranks 13th in our list of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to smart money investors. Earlier this month Paychex Inc.

Paychex Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PAYX) board also approved to buy back up to $400 million of its common stock beginning February 1, 2024 and expiring on May 31, 2027.

Ensemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) (3.71% weight in the Fund): While employment growth was strong in 2023, the Fed’s efforts to moderate job growth was successful. Paychex business is driven by the number of employees on the payrolls of its small to medium size business customers. With recession worries percolating all year, the stock was flat on a year to date basis in late October just as the economic outlook began to brighten. As recession worries faded the stock rallied to gains of as much as 13% in the fourth quarter. But in the late December earnings report, the company said that core payroll services growth would be a bit weaker than investors expected. Despite this, the company slightly raised full year earnings guidance as demand for their full service solution that incorporates human resources services beyond payroll improved. The stock finished the quarter up 4.1%.”

12. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 48

In December, Morgan Stanley published a list of 32 stocks with high free cash flow, high earnings per share growth, and an overweight rating in its U.S. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) made it to the list.

11. Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 53

Oppenheimer recently started covering Builders FirstSource with an Outperform rating. Here is what the firm said about Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):

“The company has a market-leading position in a fragmented industry and should benefit from our optimistic view of single-family housing starts in 2024. Growth in value-added products increases the amount of revenue tied to services and is a positive for gross margin and returns.”

Over the past one year Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) shares have gained about 124%.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Bonhoeffer Capital Management stated the following regarding Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):

“Over the past 12 months, interest rates have been increasing, which has reduced the economics of this strategy; but a large spread still exists if assets can be purchased at the right price. Increasing interest rates has affected the returns on public LBO firms. Some firms, like Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) (described below), have reacted to higher interest rates by moderating their use of debt in their expansion plans.

10. Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 55

With a dividend yield of 3.7% and a low PE ratio, Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a notable member of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF portfolio. The stock is up about 3.9% over the past six months.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management which owns a $358 million stake in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD).

In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD):

“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”

9. Target Corp (NYSE:TGT)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 58

US retailer Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is a key part of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF. The stock has a dividend yield of over 3% and had 58 hedge fund investors as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.

Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is also among the stocks Morgan Stanley is recommending for 2024.

Like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), hedge funds are also buying Target.

In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT):

“Other meaningful moves during the quarter included additions to cyclical growers we consider early cycle consumer plays: Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), a position initiated in the third quarter, and Estee Lauder. As earnings start to recover, these stocks and semiconductors tend to be among the first to move. We may be a little early and could see some choppiness in stock prices as job growth and consumer spending cool due to the lagged effects of Fed tightening, but we believe we’re closer to the bottom in terms of economic activity and that both companies, as well as Union Pacific, are well-positioned to benefit as consumer sentiment improves and the economy begins to recover.”

8. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 64

Piper Sandler recently said in a report that Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares have ""reversed"" a downtrend and the investment firm expects more upside to the stock.

Piper Sandler mentioned this in its Technical Research report on SMID Momentum. Piper Sandler said:

“We are optimistic about equities with the (SPX), (INDU), and (NDX) hitting record highs, but waning market breadth is a notable concern. We saw some signs of rotation yesterday as SMID-caps began rallying out of their three-week pullbacks.”

Oakmark Fund made the following comment about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

7. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 65

Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) ranks seventh in our list of the most undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 65 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY).

In addition to BMY, hedge funds are also piling into Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and The Walt Disney Company. We added Texas Instruments as a new position. Bristol-Myers has been dealing with the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid, one of its key products. Although the company is launching new drugs in melanoma, heart failure, and psoriasis it will need additional products to offset the lower revenue in Revlimid.”

6. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 65

Earlier in January, BofA listed its Efficient Growth Index top members for 2023’s fourth quarter in its RIC Report. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was part of the list of stocks mentioned in the report.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In a recent incident, an iPhone user managed to recover their stolen device from an EcoATM kiosk at Walmart Inc., thanks to Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""Find My"" app’s location tracking feature.

What Happened: A user posted on Reddit that their iPhone 15 was stolen at their workplace. The thief turned off the device, making it untraceable. Assuming the phone was lost for good, the user settled their old phone’s dues and bought a new one.

The next day, the “Find My” app started displaying the phone’s changing locations. Eventually, the device’s location was traced to a nearby Walmart. The user and a friend went to the store and began looking for the phone.

The stolen iPhone was finally found in Walmart's EcoATM kiosk, which purchases used phones for cash. After contacting the local police, the user retrieved the device from the machine.

Why It Matters: This incident underscores the effectiveness of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) “Find My” app, despite previous reports of it leading iPhone owners on a wild goose chase. In April 2023, multiple iPhone owners were led to a single Texas address due to alleged faulty Maps data.

The utility of the “Find My” feature extends beyond iPhones. In June 2023, Apple announced an iOS 17 update that made it easier to locate a misplaced Apple Watch using the Control Center.

How To Enable ‘Find My' On iPhone

Open the Settings app and tap your name.

Tap Find My, and if you want to inform your friends and family about your location, enable Share My Location.

Now, tap and enable Find My iPhone.

You can also find your iPhone even when it's offline by enabling ""Find My network.""

Make sure you have enabled Location Services on your iPhone to be able to locate your device on a map.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"The Apple iPad has turned 14. Launched on Jan. 27, 2010, the iPad was subject to jokes before becoming a category-defining product.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder and then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPad as a ""magical and revolutionary device"" that could do everything from browsing the web, sending and receiving emails, reading books and playing games, among other things.

A ‘Magical' Device

""iPad is our most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price,"" Jobs said, adding that it would create an ""entirely new category of devices.""

Over the next decade and a half, Jobs was proven right and Apple capitalized on the first-mover advantage — one in two tablets being used worldwide is an iPad, according to data from Statcounter.

Apple put the iPad on sale for the first time on Apr. 3, 2010 and ended up selling over 300,000 units in just one day.

Jobs announced the iPad 2 in March 2011, and revealed that Apple sold 15 million iPads in the first nine months of it going on sale.

Apple has since launched 10 generations of the iPad and, apart from the standard variant, announced Mini, Air and Pro variants.

iPad Is Not Apple's First Tablet

A little fun fact: Did you know the iPad was not Apple's first tablet? Under John Sculley's leadership, Apple launched a tablet-like device called the Newton MessagePad.

""What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes,"" Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said in a 1983 speech.

However, the Newton MessagePad was not well received and was discontinued by Jobs.

Let’s look at how Apple stock has fared since the company launched the iPad 14 years ago.

Apple stock price from Jan. 27, 2010, till today

Apple’s stock, adjusted for stock splits and other corporate actions, was $7.4243 on Jan. 27, 2010.

Its stock price today is $194.17, which is an increase of 2,515% during this period.

Value of a $1,000 investment in Apple stock, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices, respectively, from Jan. 27, 2010, till today

If you had invested $1,000 in Apple stock on Jan. 27, 2010, today, you would have $26,153.

Likewise, if you had invested $1,000 in an index fund replicating Nasdaq, you would have $6,982.

A similar $1,000 investment in an index fund that replicates the S&P 500 would be worth $4,459.

A Multi-billion Dollar Business

Since the iPad's release in 2010, Apple has launched a few other products like the Apple Watch, AirPods, and, more recently, Vision Pro.

Apple's iPads alone made the company over $28 billion in its FY23, accounting for 7.4% of the company’s topline.

Apple has since expanded the use case for iPads from simple reading and entertainment devices to something that can be used by creators as well. The iPad Pro models are tailored for productivity and creation, sporting a large, high-resolution display and featuring powerful M-series chipsets.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"REX Shares is boosting the distribution rate of FEPI, its only exchange-traded fund, which has pulled in millions from investors since it launched in October with a strategy similar to JPMorgan’s popular JEPI.

The $37.6 million REX FANG & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF (FEPI) will distribute $1.20 a share to holders, a nearly 26% rate, the company announced yesterday. That’s up from previous distributions of $1.18 and $1.15.

Boosting the payout comes as investors have more than doubled FEPI’s assets under management this year, adding $26.5 million to the fund that’s experienced next to zero in outflows, according to etf.com data. The far larger, $31 billion JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), which also follows a covered call strategy, has been boosting its dividend, from 29 cents a share in August to about 43 cents in December.

A covered call ETF strategy intends to generate income for investors, in which they sell call options on a security they own in exchange for a premium. The premium received from selling the call option provides additional income for the investor.

FEPI Holds Gaining Netflix Shares

Investing in volatile tech stocks may boost income, and FEPI’s top holdings include Palo Alto Networks Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Apple Inc. The fund also holds Netflix Inc., whose stock jumped today after reporting positive quarterly results.

“The more volatile the underlying stocks, the more income you can generate by writing calls,” etf.com senior analyst Sumit Roy said. “That's good for FEPI.”

While FEPI has gained 3.3% this month, the broader tech stock ETF Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) has added 4.7%.

“The trade-off is you give up some upside if the underlying stocks go up a lot, which they have been doing recently,” Roy said

AAPL,2025-04-22,"The Magnificent Seven tech stocks, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), are again driving the stock market’s surge.

These tech giants, known for their stellar performance last year, have returned 4.4% this month, outperforming the S&P 500.

Investors are flocking to tech stocks, with approximately $4 billion poured into tech funds in the past two weeks, marking the most significant inflow since August, the Wall Street Journal reports.

In 2023, these seven stocks collectively doubled in value, adding a staggering $5.1 trillion to their market capitalization.

Among these tech giants, Nvidia is a critical player in the ongoing tech-driven rally.

The company’s success is closely linked to the surging demand for semiconductor chips, especially those used to power artificial intelligence (AI) programs.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), a significant supplier for semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, recently announced its expected 20% revenue growth for the year.

Analysts remained bullish on Nvidia, citing improving PCs, AI deep learning, and inferencing markets now with generative AI tailwinds, gaming trends, automotive, and data centers.

The Big Tech stocks remain invested in ramping up their AI capabilities. Analysts have voiced $1 trillion in AI-driven opportunity for Nvidia being the frontrunner in GPU and chip supply.

This growing demand is a critical factor in the resurgence of these tech stocks and the broader stock market.

While the Magnificent Seven tech stocks have been performing well, it’s important to note that their returns this year, although impressive, have not reached the levels seen in the previous January.

Despite the slightly more modest outlook, Wall Street analysts recommend these stocks, projecting an average return of 8.6% for the group over the next 12 months.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to release earnings results for its fiscal first quarter, after the closing bell on Feb. 1, 2024.

Analysts expect the iPhone maker to report quarterly earnings at $2.10 per share on revenue of $118.03 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Apple has requested a U.K. tribunal to dismiss a lawsuit worth close to $1 billion. The lawsuit, brought forth by over 1,500 app developers, alleges that Cupertino imposes unfair App Store charges.

The company also launched its newest iPhone software update, iOS 17.3, and it comes with several innovative features.

With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, Apple has a dividend yield of 0.49%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents a share (96 cents a year).

To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).

Next, we take this amount and divide it by Apple’s $0.96 dividend: $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 shares

So, an investor would need to own approximately $1,219,875 worth of Apple, or 6,250 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.

Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares, or $243,975 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).

Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).

Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.

12. Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 18

Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) is one of the most shorted stocks in the EV space amid fears regarding production and uncertainty in 2024 due to upcoming elections. Earlier this month, the stock fell to an all-time low after Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) said it produced 2,391 vehicles during the last quarter of 2023 and delivered 1,734 vehicles, better than the analyst estimates for 1,696 vehicles delivered.

11. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 18

As US presidential elections 2024 inch closer, investors are starting to closely watch EV companies as a new government in the US could make or break EV stocks amid new policies. Analysts believe if Republicans come into power and make policies unfriendly to US EV companies, it would bode well for Chinese EV companies like Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) which would also plan faster expansion in other markets.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) during this period was Jos Shaver's Electron Capital Partners which owns a $38 million stake in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO).

10. Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 34

Brazilian mining giant Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) ranks 10th in our list of the top buzzing stocks to buy now. The stock is moving after Bloomberg reported that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants his former finance minister to be the next CEO of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).

In December, Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) disclosed that its iron ore production of 310M-320M metric tons in 2024 will be flat when compared to 2023.

A total of 34 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE). The biggest stakeholder of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) during this period was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $243 million stake in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).

Miller Value Partners Income Strategy made the following comment about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) fell during the quarter with iron ore prices. The company reported 1Q23 revenue of $8.44B, -22.7% Y/Y, below consensus of $8.79B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.69B, compared to 1Q22 EBITDA of $6.55B, below consensus of $4.49B. The Brazilian miner produced 66.8 million tons (Mt) of iron ore in 1Q23, +5.8% Y/Y, below consensus of 67.7 Mt, 67.0 thousand tons (kt) of copper, +18.4% Y/Y, and 41.0 kt of nickel, -10.5% Y/Y. Although management reaffirmed its FY23 production guidance, analysts seemed to be concerned by the negatively offsetting impacts of weaker iron ore prices as China, the world’s largest iron ore buyer, has threatened to curb any “unreasonable” price gains for the metal in an effort to prevent this year’s steel output from exceeding 2022 levels. Vale generated 1Q23 free cash flow (FCF) of $2.28B, bringing trailing-twelve month (TTM) FCF to $6.73B, or a FCF yield of 11.3%. The company repurchased $763MM worth of shares in the quarter and paid $1.80B in dividends, bringing total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter to $2.56B, or 4.3% of the company’s market cap.”

9. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43

Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) ranks ninth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Earlier this month Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) posted domestic Q4 sales volumes, with record electric vehicle (EV) numbers. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) sold 25,937 EVs in the period, a growth of 24% on a YoY basis.

8. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 52

AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) is buzzing as investors get ready to see the company's fourth quarter earnings report. Earlier in the month Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $21 price target.

Oppenheimer's analysts see several tailwinds for the stock, including AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) 120MHz C-Band portfolio which now covers over 200M point of presence, or POPs. Oppenheimer said that about 60% of AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) subscribers are now fiber, which means healthier margins and pricing leverage.

In addition to AT&T, other stocks trending right now include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). AT&T is one of the most buzzing stocks to buy right now popular among hedge funds.

Miller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.

7. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 70

Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is creating a buzz as investors get ready to receive Intel Corp's (NASDAQ:INTC) earnings report slated to be released on January 25. Recently, a Gartner report said Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) ranked first in the list of top semiconductor companies in 2023, with a total semiconductor revenue of $48.7 billion.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The most significant stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is owned by William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management which owns a $468 million stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel ranks fifth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.

Upslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”

6. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 81

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are creating a buzz on the Wall Street as investors await Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings that are set to be announced on January 24. The stock also came in the limelight after Elon Musk expressed his desire to have about 25% voting control over Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in order to make Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) a leader in AI and robotics. Tesla ranks sixth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Like Tesla, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also trending.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have gained about 47% over the past one year. Some analysts expect Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings to come in weaker than expected amid pricing wars in the EV sector.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Tsai Capital Corporation stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Tech giant Apple Inc. has entered the virtual reality (VR) competition with the recent announcement of its new product Vision Pro. Set to be available for preorders in February, the unveiling of this cutting-edge device marks a significant milestone for Apple.

Apple experienced a remarkable 45% stock price rise last year, but shares are about flat to start 2024, fortunate to even bounce back after two prominent analyst downgrades. Coming off a 2.8% year-over-year decline in revenue in 2023, Apple will need to sell and execute its future.

This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?

Management is betting big on VR to get it there. Apple CEO Tim Cook has long been known as an operational genius, not a product genius, which makes this technological innovation potentially legacy-defining.

With this new hot product, the spotlight is now on Apple, and the question looms whether Vision Pro can give a boost to its sales to justify its roughly 30 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

The Vision Pro, priced at $3,499, is positioning itself as a high-end competitor in the market. This places it at seven times the cost of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Quest 3, a virtual-reality headset priced at $500.

The significant price difference raises questions about the features and capabilities that justify Vision Pro’s premium positioning compared to Meta’s offering. Price was called out by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerburg, who reportedly said Apple's vision is ""not the one [he] wants.""

Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), a key and established player in the VR space, introduced its first virtual-reality headset, the Oculus Quest, in 2019. Its latest release, the Quest 3, hit the market in October, further intensifying competition in the VR sector.

But several industry giants have competing views on what the metaverse is and should be. Warner Bros.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In April 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched the first Apple computer, marking the beginning of what would become a technology powerhouse. At age 21, Jobs sold his Volkswagen bus for $1,500, while Wozniak sold his Hewlett-Packard calculator for $500. Together, the sales provided the funds for their initial venture​​.

With this capital, Jobs and Wozniak embarked on producing the Apple I, introduced on April Fools Day in 1976. Their innovative approach soon paid off. A local computer dealer placed a substantial order for 100 units for $50,000, a significant milestone for the fledgling company. To meet this demand, they purchased parts on credit, giving them a tight timeframe of one month to fulfill the order. Leveraging the support of family and friends, they completed the order, earning their first revenue and narrowly managing to pay off the parts suppliers with just a day to spare.

Jobs and Wozniak's ingenuity continued to fuel Apple Inc.’s growth. They later met Armas Clifford ""Mike"" Markkula, a former manager at Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. and Intel Corp., who played a crucial role in the company’s development. Markkula assisted in crafting a business plan and invested $92,000, in addition to helping arrange a $250,000 credit line. This financial support was instrumental in Apple’s first hit product.

The Apple I, marketed for $666.66 each, earned the company around $774,000. Following the launch of the Apple II, Apple’s sales skyrocketed to $139 million, three years after its release.

The pivotal moment for Apple came in 1980 when it became a publicly traded company. On its first day of trading, Apple’s market value reached $1.2 billion. By the end of the day, the market capitalization stood at $1.8 billion, a remarkable achievement considering the company started in Jobs' garage.

However, the journey was not without its challenges. Apple faced significant design flaws in its subsequent products, leading to recalls and consumer disappointment. This period saw IBM surpass Apple in sales, compelling Apple to compete in an IBM/PC-dominated market.

In 1983, Jobs recruited John Sculley from Pepsi-Cola to be CEO of Apple. The following year, they released the Macintosh, marketing it as part of a counterculture lifestyle. Despite its positive sales and superior performance to IBM's PCs, the Macintosh struggled with compatibility issues with IBM systems.

Because of internal disagreements and strategic differences, Jobs was eventually phased out of the company he co-founded and left Apple in 1985.

Jobs returned to Apple as CEO in 1997. He played a pivotal role in reviving the company, which was facing financial turmoil and was said to be on the verge of bankruptcy.

Over the years, Apple transformed from a personal computer company to a leader in cutting-edge digital products. By the time of Jobs’ death in 2011, Apple had achieved a market value of $391 billion, a testament to his vision, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.

Investors across the globe are increasingly drawn to stocks that provide regular dividends as a strategy to secure a steady income stream. To enhance wealth accumulation, opting for investments in global dividend companies presents an advantageous approach. When investors choose global dividend companies, they are essentially selecting businesses with a widespread international presence. These companies have proven themselves capable of generating profits on a global scale, often demonstrating resilience across different markets and economic conditions. By diversifying investments across such globally positioned firms, investors not only gain exposure to a variety of industries but also mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stand out as notable examples of robust dividend-paying entities that boast a strong and influential global footprint.

In 2022, global dividends experienced substantial growth, registering an impressive 8.4% increase to reach a historic high of $1.56 trillion, in line with the projections outlined by the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. This growth was marked by record payouts in 12 countries, and a notable 88% of companies either raised or maintained their dividend payouts. However, the momentum in global dividends took a downturn in 2023. This decline was attributed to reduced special dividends and a limited number of corporations implementing significant cuts to investor remuneration. Although the comprehensive data for the entire year is yet to be disclosed, the third-quarter report from Janus Henderson revealed a 0.9% decrease in global dividends to $421.9 billion during that period. As a consequence of these developments, there was a slight adjustment to the 2023 dividend forecast, with the estimate revised to $1.63 trillion from the previous projection of $1.64 trillion. Despite this marginal reduction, the forecasted figure still represents a record-breaking amount, showcasing a 4.4% increase from the global dividends recorded in 2022.",0.1782709750566893,0.3320922728065584,Positive,0.998219072818756,0.4539655556909717

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC projected on Thursday more than 20% growth in 2024 revenue on booming demand for high-end chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications even as the broader industry deals with weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc and Nvidia supplier, said at an earnings conference that AI represented a major opportunity

""We are a key enabler for AI applications. So far today, everything you saw for AI comes from TSMC,"" CEO C.C. Wei said at the conference, after the company reported a fourth quarter net profit that beat market expectations.

For advanced packaging, demand was very strong and TSMC can't offer enough capacity to support customers, which will continue to next year, he added.

But Wei said that for the industry overall, he was worried about over-capacity for mature nodes.

""There might be too much capacity being built right now for mature nodes. So the concern on over-capacity is valid,"" he said, though he added that it was not a concern for TSMC due to strong customer demand for its speciality technologies.

Looking ahead, TSMC said it plans to expand its global manufacturing footprint, with construction at its fab plant in Germany expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, while TSMC is still deciding on what technology node to build at a second fab in Arizona.

A first fab in Japan will open next month with volume production in the fourth quarter, while the company was also exploring building a second factory in the country.

It forecast capital spending at $28-$32 billion for this year, in line with 2023, and said it will also expand production at home in Taiwan.

TSMC said it is evaluating building a third fab in the southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung, and if it goes ahead all three fabs there will be for advanced 2 nanometre chips, due to strong demand driven by high performance computing and smartphones.

TSMC posted a 19% drop in net profit for the October-December quarter to T$238.7 billion ($7.6 billion) from a particularly strong year-earlier quarter.

The profit, though, beat a T$226.4 billion LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.

""Our fourth quarter business was supported by the continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology,"" said Wendell Huang, TSMC's chief financial officer.

He said the current quarter would be impacted by seasonality of the smartphone business, which would be partially offset by strength in its high-performance computing segment that includes AI chips.

While the company said 2023 was challenging, it forecast solid growth for this year, adding that it expects inventories to return to a healthy level.

Revenue for 2024 should increase in the low to mid-20% range in U.S. dollar terms, it said.

TSMC's Taipei-listed shares surged 32% last year. The stock rose 1.2% on Thursday ahead of the results versus a 0.4% gain for the benchmark index, giving the company a market value of $478.3 billion.

As the inflation levels slow, the Federal Reserve is poised to begin cutting interest rates from March, which should boost equities.

Microsoft Corp.

Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is on track to become the world's largest company in terms of market cap, as its shares rose by over 5% last week to hit a market capitalization of $2.89 trillion, surpassing Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) $2.87 trillion market cap.

Microsoft's strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence (AI) drove the tech behemoth's growth over the past year, as its stake in OpenAI paid off tremendously.

“With co-pilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere,” Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in an earnings release. “We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers.""

Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard Inc. in a historic merger, allowing the former to become the third-largest gaming company in terms of revenue. Wall Street analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to rise by over 14% year over year to $243.8 billion in fiscal 2024. In addition, the consensus annual earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $11.24 indicates an 11.6% improvement year over year.

Piper Sandler has an Overweight rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of $455, indicating a potential upside of over 17%.

Eli Lilly and Co.

Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY), one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the U.S., recently made headlines as its weight-loss drug Zepbound went viral shortly after its launch in November. The weekly prescription demand for Zepbound crossed 25,000 per week by the end of December, surpassing the current supply level for the drug.

Amid supply shortage concerns, Eli Lilly plans to build a new factory in Germany while expanding its facility in North Carolina.

Analysts expect Eli Lilly's financials to improve significantly as the demand for Zepbound remains strong. The consensus revenue estimate of $8.5 billion for the fiscal first quarter ending in March indicates a 22.1% rise year over year. The company's EPS is expected to increase by over 54% year over year to $2.51 in the ongoing quarter.

Shares of Eli Lilly have been one of the best-performing pharma stocks over the past year, surging by over 77%.

Nvidia Corp.

Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock with its shares rising by more than 220% over the past year. The relatively new chip manufacturer made its name by capitalizing on the AI boom, designing chips catering to AI-related tasks.

Nvidia's chips hold an 85% market share in the artificial intelligence sector, making it the industry leader with a substantial competitive advantage. Shares of Nvidia have risen by nearly 10.5% so far this year.

As the AI boom gains traction, Nvidia is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing companies in the near term. The company's dominant market position has allowed it to maintain robust demand in international markets as well — China keeps buying Nvidia chips despite growing geopolitical tensions with the U.S.

Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to rise 231.8% year over year to $20.08 billion in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ending in January. In addition, the consensus EPS estimate of $4.5 for the current quarter indicates a 411.4% rise from the same period last year.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and Top 11 Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 2024 Predictions and His Top 5 Stock Picks.

Jim Cramer kicked off 2024 with an observation that the market might be undergoing a rotation where investors are taking profits from major mega-cap tech stocks and pouring these profits into the laggards of 2023 like banks, healthcare and consumer companies.

What Jim Cramer's 'Crystal Ball' Says About 2024

Jim Cramer said that according to his ""crystal ball,"" investors this year would take profits selling ""best of the best"" and invest in companies that ""haven’t gotten respect for ages."" By best of the best Cramer meant the Magnificent Seven group of stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and ""richly valued"" software companies.

Cramer talked about his early days in the Wall Street where the beginning of every new year would bring excitement and enthusiasm among investors that caused ""repositioning"" in the market. Cramer said that most of the times this repositioning is temporary and does not have a lot of importance in the long run. Cramer said that some circles believe the Magnificent Seven group of stocks won't be able to sustain their rally. Cramer said he reluctantly agrees with this notion but long-term investors should approach these sell-offs as buying opportunities.

""A Heck With These Traders""

Cramer predicted that 2024 markets would be defined by what the Fed does about inflation as traders will keep looking over their shoulder for the next inflation report and Jerome Powell's comments. But Cramer advised his viewers to ""don’t be one of those people,"" referring to investors who impulsively react to any ""utterances"" from the Fed, traders, economists or politicians about the stock market.

Cramer expressed his frustration with this short-term, reactive investing approach and said:

""Me? I say a heck with these traders.""

Cramer Says AI and Software Bubbles Will Pop

Jim Cramer said during beginning of every new year investors usually sell stocks that perform extremely well in the previous year and invest their money into beaten down stocks. But that trend changes after earnings season begins and investors come back to top performers of the previous year. Jim Cramer predicted that the artificial intelligence and enterprises software ""bubbles will be popped."" But once these stocks come back to reasonable valuations compared to other stocks they will once again be bought, Cramer thinks.

Jim Cramer went through different sectors to weigh options for investors. For the healthcare sector, Cramer said ""no thank you"" since he believes healthcare stocks do not perform well during election years. For retail, Cramer said these companies are ""finally getting their arms around the shoplifting problem"" and could produce better returns. For the oil industry, Cramer said ""very difficult"" since ""we produce so much crude in this country"" that it's hard for oil prices to go higher.

Wait for the Sell-Off and Then Do ""Some Buying""

Jim Cramer said he told his investing club members that they'll be ""rewarded"" if they bought stocks with decent valuations, not dramatically expensive when compared to average S&P 500 multiples. Cramer said investors should be patient and wait for the sell-off he's expecting and then do ""some buying.""

Sound Shore Management made the following comment about GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“That said, current macro factors of higher inflation, rising rates, and a slowing economy are affecting stock prices in the short-term. Against this backdrop, many consumer stocks and financing-based business models declined in the third quarter. For example, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) was our largest detractor for the period. A recent spinout from GE, the company is the world’s largest medical imaging supplier with steady growth and higher margins. We purchased the stock in the first quarter of 2023 when it was trading at 14 times normalized earnings, a significant discount to peers. Our research concluded that GEHC’s profit margins were temporarily depressed due to the spinoff and one-time Research & Development charges, and that management’s plan for improvement was credible. The stock got off to a strong start early in the year, but returned the bulk of its gains as higher borrowing rates for their customers created demand uncertainty. As well, 15% of GE Healthcare’s business is from China, where demand has slowed along with the economy. We view these headwinds as temporary, and added to our position during the stock’s recent pullback.”

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 46

Like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Cramer is bullish on HWM.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Panasonic Holdings Corp (OTC: PCRFF) (OTC: PCRFY) and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) have teamed up to create smart televisions, integrating Amazon's Fire TV streaming technology.

The companies revealed the venture at the CES 2024 event in Las Vegas, featuring an OLED model set to launch in Japan and Europe this spring.

Panasonic Entertainment & Communication, a subsidiary specializing in TVs and cameras, is collaborating with Amazon to develop the software for these TVs, the Nikkei Asia reports.

The Smart TVs will recommend content based on individual viewing habits, considering streaming services, broadcast TV, and previously recorded shows.

The companies proposed enhancing the personalized approach by creating separate accounts for each family member, analyzing their specific viewing patterns, and searching keywords.

Initial models will require manual account selection, but Panasonic plans to incorporate voice and fingerprint recognition in future versions for automatic user identification.

The company also aims to synchronize these TVs with in-vehicle displays, allowing the continuation of content from home to car, and with smartphones to analyze app-based video consumption for more precise content recommendations.

In 2022, global shipments of flat-screen TVs saw a 5% decline, dropping to 203 million units, influenced by reduced pandemic demand and a challenging global economy.

According to data from the U.K. research company Omdia, this market shift places South Korean and Chinese manufacturers like Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) and Hisense at the forefront, collectively holding over 60% of the global market share, Nikkei Asia writes.

Despite this competitive landscape, Panasonic has a modest 1% share in the worldwide TV market.

Also this week, Amazon launched Matter Casting. This new feature competes with Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) AirPlay, enabling iPhone and Android users to wirelessly stream videos to Amazon's TV devices like Fire TV units and Echo Show 15.

This innovation is part of Amazon's push for interoperable services. Initially, Matter Casting will focus on streaming content from Amazon's Prime Video app to Echo Show devices.

The production of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones in India has reached a groundbreaking level, exceeding INR 1 trillion ($13.5 billion) last year. According to data, obtained by the Indian daily Economic Times, iPhones valued at INR 650 billion ($8.8 billion) were exported from January to December.

An insider with knowledge of the production process explained, ""The [INR 1 trillion] figure denotes the freight on board (FOB) value as the products leave the factory. After factoring in taxes and dealer margins in various countries, the market value could range from INR 1.5 trillion ($20.3 billion) to INR 1.7 trillion ($23 billion).""

FOB refers to the cost of the goods as they depart the factory, excluding taxes and other charges. Apple's impressive performance has surpassed the targets set under India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, possibly earning the company's contract manufacturers additional rewards according to the scheme's financial provisions.

This milestone highlights the Indian government's efforts to shift global supply chains from China to India.

Apple has notably become one of India's leading mobile phone manufacturers by market value. The technology juggernaut has boosted its market share in India from 2% in FY18 to 6% in FY23, as reported by Counterpoint. During this period, Apple’s revenues in India soared to INR 493.22 billion ($6.7 billion) from INR 130.97 billion ($1.8 billion). In contrast, despite a decrease in market share, Samsung's mobile revenues grew to INR 703 billion ($9.5 billion) from INR 373 billion ($5 billion).

Apple is also nurturing a strong network of Indian suppliers, such as a unit of the Tata Group, further strengthening its shift away from China.

Technology stocks, especially the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, absolutely rocked in 2023 thanks to the AI-fueled rally. While the enthusiasm around AI is just getting started, many analysts believe in 2024 the broader market gains enjoyed by tech stocks last year will expand to other sectors while mega-cap tech stocks will take a back seat. Delano Saporu, Founder and CEO of New Street Advisors Group, while talking to CNBC earlier this month said that Magnificent Seven stocks are expected to take a breather in 2024 while market gains will broaden out to other sectors.

Recently, Jim Cramer also talked about his forecasts for 2024 and said that there is a market rotation going on right now in which money managers are taking profits by selling major technology stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and investing this money into other sectors like financials, healthcare and small-cap companies which remained on the back burner in 2023.

David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, also thinks that Magnificent Seven stocks are not expected to always outperform and investors should look beyond these stocks in 2024. Discussing his portfolio performance on CNBC, Katz said over the past two years Magnificent Seven stocks on average are up just about 8%. He said that for 2024 he’s expecting the laggards of 2023 to “catch up.”

In this backdrop, it’s important to take a look at some of the top non-tech stocks that have been posting high revenue growth over the past few months and years.

For this article we first used a stock screener to identify profitable non-tech companies with about 20%+ quarter-over-quarter revenue growth recently and over 20% revenue growth over the past five years. From these companies we selected 17 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

17. Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 11

Canadian banking company Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) is a stock with decent revenue growth over the past few years.

In November, Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS) posted Q4 results. Revenue in the period jumped 8.9% year over year.

16. HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 38

With 38 hedge funds having stakes in it, Indian banking company HDFC Bank Ltd (NYSE:HDB) ranks 16th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors.

15. Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 39

Texas-based Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) is one of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 39 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW). The most significant stakeholder of Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW) during this period was Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management which owns an $82 million stake in Tidewater Inc (NYSE:TDW).

Many analysts believe small- and mid-cap stocks like TDW are headed for a rebound in 2024 while mega-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will take a breather.

Third Avenue Small-Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Finally, long-time holding, offshore oil services company, Tidewater Inc. (NYSE:TDW) rose 31% in the quarter, as more investors and operators recognized the importance of investing in fossil fuels to sustain long-term economic growth and national security. In a challenging environment for most asset classes, Energy was a considerable outperformer this past quarter, illustrating the potency of the investor pivot.”

14. Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 40

Entertainment company Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) shares have gained about 23% over the past six months. In December, Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) received several upgrades and bullish comments from Wall Street firms. Among the Wall Street firms bullish on the stock is Morgan Stanley, whose analyst Cameron Mansson-Perrone said the stock’s valuation is attractive. The analyst said Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) has lagged the market by 2,000 basis points since the end of 2021 despite return on capital improvements.

A total of 40 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) as of the end of the September quarter.

Baron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Liberty Media Corporation-Liberty Live is a tracking stock created on 8/4/2023 representing Liberty Media Corporation’s holdings in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”

13. Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 41

Insurance company Renaissancere Holdings Ltd (NYSE:RNR) ranks 13th in our list of the best high-growth non-tech stocks to buy according to smart money investors.

“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR), a provider of reinsurance and insurance products, surged ahead by 6%. Its second quarter numbers were solid across underwriting, property catastrophe premiums, investment income, and fee income. While there was an impact from severe storms during the quarter, RenRe’s losses were modest.”

“Several stocks in the portfolio had strong returns over the period. Global cruise vacation company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), was one of the top 3 performers in the S&P 500 during the quarter. Shares surged following a significant top- and bottom-line earnings beat, as stronger than anticipated consumer demand is driving a record WAVE season. Forward booking trends are also ahead of historical ranges at record pricing. These factors combined with further improvement in onboard spend and solid cost containment led management to increase RCL’s full-year 2023 guidance. We believe the revised revenue and earnings outlook lays the foundation for RCL to exceed its’ three-year strategic imperative, the Trifecta Program.”

Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), the diabetes management device company, was the second largest detractor to portfolio performance. The company was hit by negative sentiment regarding GLP-1 agonists and their potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on insulin therapy. Type 1 diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, which could offset the lower outlook for cases of type 2 diabetes, but the market ignored this development.”

The operational and logistical challenges of operating in nuclear medicine provide Lantheus a durable moat in this emerging therapeutic market.”

9. Everest Group Ltd (NYSE:EG)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 44

Management consulting company Everest Group Ltd (NYSE:EG) was one of the stocks in the list of high-growth stocks trading at attractive valuations published by Goldman Sachs’ U.S. Weekly Kickstart in December.

“The Fund’s largest position is First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA) (“First Citizens” or “FCNCA”). We acquired our stake over the past three years. Initially, we owned and traded around a small position in CIT Group Inc. (“CIT”) during the summer of 2020. We felt CIT was undervalued and management was making progress in reducing risk during the Covid-19 pandemic. In late 2020, CIT agreed to be acquired by First Citizens. We added to our CIT stake the morning of the acquisition announcement because we thought the acquisition was so financially attractive that First Citizens’ shares would rally and pull CIT’s shares higher. Our CIT shares were exchanged for First Citizens shares when the merger completed. We held onto our First Citizens shares because we admired the management team, we felt the bank was undervalued, and we projected the bank would benefit from higher interest rates. Then, earlier this year, First Citizens was the winning bidder in the FDIC’s auction of the failed Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). We added significantly to the Fund’s First Citizens position on the following Monday morning because the deal was unbelievably favorable for First Citizens.

“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. Their company’s second quarter net interest income came in better than expected while revenues were slightly ahead.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Recommended Selling These 5 Stocks.

Jim Cramer recently said in a program that the time has come for investors to take some profits on the Magnificent Seven group of stocks as the market begins to undergo a rotation. Cramer said “it’s a new market” in 2024 and financial, healthcare and small-cap stocks which were put on the backburner by the Street amid recession fears are now in the spotlight. Cramer said that the market is favoring “boring” stocks with high yields as investors believe recession fears have been managed by the Federal Reserve and rates are expected to come down.

Cramer said long-term interest rates peaked in October 2023 and since then high-yield dividend stocks have been “flying"" while Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their leadership position when it comes to stock market gains. Cramer said that during most of 2023 Magnificent Seven stocks, which include major companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), among other tech leaders, led the stock market gains. But after October 2023, things have changed. Cramer shared a chart which showed S&P 500 performance trends on an equal-weighted basis. Data shows that an equal-weighted S&P 500 has beaten the Magnificent Seven index by 13.4% from October 2023 through January 3, 2024.

Jim Cramer said that “all sorts of stocks” are now showing strong performance and gains are no longer limited to the seven major tech stocks. Cramer mentioned some major banks and said financial stocks have been among the top performers in the current environment.

Jim Cramer also highlighted that there’s a broader money rotation going on in the market right now, with major tech stocks like Nvidia, Apple and Tesla acting as “sources of funds.” That means money managers are taking profits from these stocks and putting these funds into other companies that have hitherto been ignored amid the macro economic backdrop.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"After the latest AI announcements at the WWDC event, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.

Notable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.

Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:

“Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.”

RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:

“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.

Young Americans have always been allured by the idea of leaving their 9-to-5 grind and enjoying the prime of their lives by the beach and doing what they love. But in recent years, this idea has seen a dramatic rise in popularity. In a recent survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 45.8% of the respondents said they would likely be working after age 62. This metric averaged 55% between March 2014 and March 2020, according to the bank.

The early retirement movement gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as millions of Americans started working from home and saving money from stimulus checks. In October 2021, St. Louis Federal Reserve economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro estimated that a whopping three million Americans retired early due to the pandemic. However, this phenomenon, also known as ‘The Great Resignation,' reversed as inflation began to impact American households.

Early retirement communities such as Reddit’s /FinancialIndependence are still growing. Investing in dividend stocks is often pitched as one of the quicker and safest ways to retire early on Reddit. We scoured several discussion boards on Reddit to see the most popular dividend stocks recommended by investors on the platform for retirement based on their personal experience.

Pfizer

Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) is a notable dividend stock popular among Redditors looking to live off dividends. Pfizer shares are down about 7% over the past year. The stock yields around 6%, which is high compared to the sector average of about 2.3%. Redditors think Pfizer is going through a post-COVID slump, but it’s poised to rebound on the back of strong growth catalysts in the pipeline. During the first quarter, Pfizer’s revenue from non-COVID products saw an 11% operational growth year-over-year. Pfizer has increased its dividend for 14 straight years.

Philip Morris

With 16 consecutive years of dividend growth and a 5% yield, the tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) is a top choice for many Redditors who live entirely off dividends. Amid a decline in the popularity of traditional tobacco products, Philip Morris is aggressively expanding into tobacco-free products. The company plans to generate about two-thirds of its net revenues from nontraditional products by 2030. The company posted strong Q1 results in April and updated full-year 2024 guidance. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $1.50, surpassing estimates by $0.09, while revenue jumped 9.7% YoY to $8.8 billion, beating the consensus estimate by $350 million. Philip Morris expects its organic revenue growth in 2024 to total somewhere between 7% and 8.5%, up from its previous forecast of 6.5% to 8%.

Main Street Capital

Texas-based business development company Main Street Capital Corp (NYSE:MAIN) is one of the most popular monthly dividend stocks among Redditors in retirement and dividend communities on the social media platform. Main Street has been paying dividends consistently since 2007 and has upped its dividend every year since 2014.

Main Street’s management said during the Q1 earnings call that the company’s net investment income in the quarter was 54% higher than the monthly dividends the company paid to its shareholders and 9% more than the total dividends paid to shareholders. Total investment income in the March quarter came in at $131.6 million, easily beating the Street’s consensus of $127.9 million.

Altria

Reddit’s retirement and dividend communities love Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) because of its dividend yield (over 8%) and impressive dividend growth history (54 consecutive years of increases). Retail investors on Reddit believe the stock is undervalued and poised to grow due to recreational marijuana and tobacco-free product growth.

Last year, Altria completed its $2.75 billion acquisition of NJOY Holdings, an e-vapor products company. Analysts believe growth from the oral tobacco category and vaping products could offset declines from the smokable products segment.

Altria’s valuation is indeed depressed. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 9.05, much lower than the industry average P/E of 17.24.

IBM

International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IMB) is one of the most talked-about stocks in Reddit retirement and dividend communities since many Redditors living off dividends have the tech stock in their portfolios. IBM is that sweet spot between dividend income and stock growth, as some Redditors think the company’s cloud and AI business has the potential to boost IBM’s share.

IBM has 29 years of consecutive dividend growth and yields 3.95%. In April, IBM increased its quarterly dividend by 0.6% to $1.66 per share. During the same month, IBM said it would buy HashiCorp. for $6.4 billion. The company stated the acquisition would allow it to expand its hybrid cloud platform for AI. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said IBM has the ability to drive HashiCorp’s growth across its customer base.

Realty Income

California-based REIT Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) is one of the top monthly dividend stocks, having raised its dividends for 29 straight years. Redditors are fond of this high-yield (5.9%) dividend growth stock. Realty Income hiked its monthly dividend by 0.2% on June 11 to $0.263 per share. The company has also increased the lower end of its 2024 earnings guidance. It now expects adjusted FFO per share in the year to come in between $4.15 and $4.21, up from its prior guidance of $4.13 to $4.21.

Apple

Despite having a low yield, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the favorite dividend stocks on Reddit, as retail investors on the platform believe the iPhone maker is a solid addition to a diversified dividend portfolio. With excess cash and rising competition, Apple prioritizes shareholder returns more than ever. It has raised dividends every year over the past decade. Earlier this year, Apple hiked its dividend by 4%. It’s still a growth stock, with many analysts betting that Apple’s AI plans will bear fruit. The stock jumped to new highs after Apple’s latest AI-related announcements during the annual Worldwide Developers Conference.

In the latest note, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo praised Apple’s AI move and said the company could have a competitive edge over peers as it has ""successfully defined on-device AI.""

Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) has over six decades of dividend growth, a solid business, and a 3% yield. Redditors believe this old-school, ""boring"" dividend stock is important for any balanced dividend portfolio. Coca-Cola’s organic revenue during the first quarter jumped 11% year-over-year.

The company’s defensive business makes it an all-weather dividend stock. In May, Goldman Sachs said in a note that Coca-Cola is one of the stocks ""insulated"" from headwinds from wavering consumer spending amid rising inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Four more U.S. states on Tuesday joined the Justice Department's lawsuit against Apple Inc alleging the iPhone maker is monopolizing smartphone markets, the department said in a statement.

The four states are Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada and Washington, the Justice Department said. The original lawsuit was filed in March, and 15 states and the District of Columbia joined the lawsuit at the time.

The lawsuit alleges that Apple uses its market power to get more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants. The civil lawsuit accuses Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones, maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access from, developers.

The Justice Department has previously said Apple charges as much as $1,599 for an iPhone and makes a larger profit than any rival. Officials also said Apple imposes hidden charges on various business partners - from software developers to credit card companies and even rivals such as Alphabet's, Google, in ways that ultimately raise prices for consumers.

Apple has said it plans to ask a federal judge in New Jersey to throw the case out, arguing that it ""faces fierce competition from well-established rivals.""

A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Intel, once a glamorous semiconductor manufacturer, has suffered several setbacks in recent years due to its rigid business model and underinvestment in high-growth areas. While competitors like NVIDIA, AMD and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company have thrived, Intel has plummeted by 36% year to date, making it the worst-performing tech stock in the S&P 500.

Intel’s troubles began when it missed the mobile chip boom by failing to secure a deal with Apple Inc. The mobile chip market, now worth $23.7 billion, is dominated by TSM. Intel’s rigid business model has also contributed to the loss of its semiconductor market share to TSM and chips business to NVIDIA and AMD.

However, Intel is overhauling its business model and making significant efforts to catch up with the competition. CEO Patrick Gelsinger states that the company is accelerating its efforts to close the technology gap created by a decade of underinvestment, aiming to catch up by 2026.

Despite its challenges, Intel remains the undisputed champion in the CPU manufacturing industry, with half of its revenues coming from this segment. Canalys, a leading global technology market analyst firm, predicts that global PC shipments will explode in 2024 and 2025, driven by AI-enabled PCs. Analysts predict that Intel’s year-over-year revenues from this segment will grow by 11% in 2024 and 21% in 2025.

Intel is also expected to benefit from its Data Center and AI segment, which accounts for about 30% of its total revenues. The company’s recently released Gaudi 3 AI accelerator outperforms NVIDIA’s H100 GPU by 50% in AI tasks while being cheaper and more energy efficient.

As Intel works to reclaim its position as a market leader in the chip industry, the stock could be a good buy for long-term investing. Currently trading at the bottom of its 52-week low, Intel presents an opportunity to buy at a discount.

For income investors, Intel offers a dividend yield of 1.62% and has increased its dividend for eight consecutive years.

Looking For High-Yield Opportunities?

The current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces competition from Huawei Technologies Co’s latest AI chip, the Ascend 910B, which a Huawei executive claims matches or surpasses Nvidia’s A100 in some tests.

The Ascend 910B delivers 80% of the A100’s efficiency when training large language models and can outperform it by 20% in other tests.

These claims come amid strict US export restrictions that prevent Nvidia from shipping advanced GPUs to China, SCMP reports.

Huawei introduced the Ascend series in 2019 and has built a robust proprietary software and hardware ecosystem.

Despite the constraints, Huawei’s AI strategy has gained traction, with the Ascend chips adopted by major Chinese tech firms like Tencent Holding Ltd (OTC:TCEHY), Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), and iFlyTek. Huawei’s AI chips are integral to its goal of achieving technological self-sufficiency in China as it continues to expand its influence in the domestic market.

Analysts have noted Chinese manufacturers’ challenges in producing high-performance AI computing chips using older systems.

AI chips like Nvidia’s A100 are significantly more extensive and complex than typical smartphone chips.

However, Huawei’s Ascend 910B and Kunpeng chips have emerged as viable alternatives for domestic AI applications.

According to an analyst, while Huawei’s best chips are still technologically inferior to Nvidia’s latest GPUs, the company’s AI strategy and domestic market adaptations present substantial competition to Nvidia within China.

Reportedly, China’s leading chip manufacturer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, has been ramping up its chip production with domestic tools.

Prior reports indicated Tencent’s development of AI chips to gain a slice of Nvidia’s market share, which dominated up to 90% of China’s $7 billion AI chip market.

Meanwhile, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia remain committed to the Chinese market with their tailor-made AI chips.

Nvidia recently reached a market valuation of over $3 trillion, beating Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second most valuable company. This Wednesday, Nvidia added close to $150 billion in market cap.

Price Action: NVDA shares were trading lower by 1.15% at $1,196.05 at the last check on Friday.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) shares hit a record high due to the global AI frenzy.

Additionally, TSMC is in talks with ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) to acquire advanced lithography machines, expected by year-end.

Meanwhile, Chinese AI chip firms are designing less powerful processors to comply with U.S. sanctions, underscoring the importance of TSMC.

Recent reports indicated TSMC’s plans to raise the prices of its services.

TSMC also announced a buyback of 3.25 million shares and plans for a $7.8 billion facility in Singapore with Vanguard International Semiconductor and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI).

TSMC’s surge followed Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gains, which reached a record high, breaching Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) market cap. TSMC is a key technology supplier for Nvidia’s AI chips.

Nvidia looks to boost its investments in Taiwan, including constructing another supercomputer in Taiwan following the launch of Taipei-1 in 2023.

Interestingly, Nvidia has also tapped Samsung Electronics Co for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip supply and is eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier as TSMC struggled with supply chain constraints.

TSMC, which won the crown of the leading global foundry with a 62% market share, indicated 10% annual growth in the semiconductor industry, excluding memory chips.

Analysts don’t see the fizzling of the AI demand anytime soon, hailing Nvidia as the key beneficiary. Nvidia’s moat extends beyond gaming, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data centers.

TSMC stock gained over 63% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the semiconductor sector via First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:FTXL) and ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:SSG).

Price Action: TSM shares were trading higher by 1.94% at $166.07 premarket at the last check on Thursday.

TSMC stock also traded lower on Tuesday.

U.S. Big Tech stocks harboring AI ambitions are also trading lower Tuesday, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.Com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

TSMC’s new Chair, C.C. Wei, has already discussed his price hike plans with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the Nikkei Asia reports.

Wei justified passing down the higher value of its AI chips to its customers, like Nvidia, who were already charging a premium for their products, taking credit for their AI moat.

Huang recently voiced AI’s “$100 trillion” opportunities at his Taipei Computex tech trade fair speech.

However, Wei ruled out the possibility of migrating its fabs out of Taiwan despite political tensions, as the island accounts for 80%—90% of its production capacity.

Semiconductor sector ETFS, including VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), are trading lower on Tuesday. U.S. Big Tech ETFs, including Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and SPDR Select Sector Fund (NYSE:XLK) are down Tuesday.

This article What's Going On With Super Micro Computer Stock On Monday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com",0.0998057498057498,0.4597513597513597,Neutral,0.9611174464225768,0.5025368415853876
AAPL,2025-04-22,"NEW YORK (AP) — The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 13% last year, easily surpassing the gains for workers at a time when inflation was putting considerable pressure on Americans' budgets.

The median pay package for CEOs rose to $16.3 million, up 12.6%, according to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar. Meanwhile, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers rose 4.1% through 2023. At half the companies in AP's annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale almost 200 years to make what their CEO did.

“In this post-pandemic market, the desire is for boards to reward and retain CEOs when they feel like they have a good leader in place,” said Kelly Malafis, founding partner of Compensation Advisory Partners in New York.

The AP’s CEO compensation survey included pay data for 341 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.

Hock Tan, the CEO of Broadcom, topped the AP survey with a pay package valued at about $162 million.

Broadcom granted Tan stock awards valued at $160.5 million on Oct. 31, 2022, for the company's 2023 fiscal year. Tan was given the opportunity to earn up to 1 million shares starting in fiscal 2025, according to a securities filing, provided that Broadcom’s stock meets certain targets – and he remains CEO for five years.

At the time of the award, Broadcom’s stock was trading at $470. The stock has skyrocketed since, and reached an all-time high of $1,436.17 on May 15. Tan will receive the full award if the average closing price is at or above $1,125 for 20 consecutive days between October 2025 and October 2027.

Broadcom noted that under Tan its market value has increased from $3.8 billion in 2009 to $645 billion (as of May 23) and that its total shareholder return during that time easily surpassed that of the S&P 500.

Other CEOs at the top of AP’s survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million).

Lisa Su, CEO of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, was the highest paid female CEO in the AP survey for the fifth year in a row in fiscal 2023, bringing in compensation valued at $30.3 million — flat with her compensation package in 2022. Her overall rank rose to 21 from 25.

Workers across the country have been winning higher pay since the pandemic, with wages and benefits for private-sector employees rising 4.1% in 2023 after a 5.1% increase in 2022, according to the Labor Department.

Even with those gains, the gap between the person in the corner office and everyone else keeps getting wider. Half the CEOs in this year’s pay survey made at least 196 times what their median employee earned. That’s up from 185 times in last year’s survey.

The disparity between what the chief executive makes and the workers earn wasn't always so wide.

After World War II and up until the 1980s, CEOs of large publicly traded companies made about 40 to 50 times the average worker’s pay, said Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets for the AFL-CIO, which runs an Executive Paywatch website that tracks CEO pay.

“The (current) pay ratio signals a sort of a winner take all culture, that companies are treating their CEOs as, you know, as superstars as opposed to, team players,” Rees said.

Despite the criticism, shareholders tend to give overwhelming support to pay packages for company leaders. From 2019 to 2023, companies typically received just under 90% of the vote for their executive compensation plans, according to data from Equilar.

Shareholders do, however, occasionally reject a compensation plan, although the votes are non-binding. In 2023, shareholders at 13 companies in the S&P 500 gave the pay package less than 50% support.

Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said Say on Pay votes are important because they “shine a spotlight on some of the most egregious cases of executive access, and it can lead to negotiations over pay and other issues that shareholders might want to raise with corporate leadership.”

After its investors gave another resounding thumbs down to the pay packages for its top executives, Netflix met with many of its biggest shareholders last year to discuss their concerns.

Following the talks, Netflix announced several changes to redesign its pay policies. For one, it eliminated executives’ choice to allocate their compensation between cash and options. It will no longer give out stock options, which can give executives a payday as long as the stock price stays above a certain level. Instead, the company will give restricted stock that executives can profit from only after a certain amount of time or after certain performance measures are met.

The changes will take effect in 2024.

More broadly, say on pay votes haven't made a big difference, Anderson says. “I think the impact, certainly on the overall size of CEO packages has not had much effect in some cases.”

DHOLERA, India /NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans a raft of business-friendly measures if he wins a third term this week, including pushing through regulations making it easier to hire and fire workers, according to two government officials familiar with the matter.

As part of an election pledge to transform India into a global manufacturing hub, Modi wants to offer subsidies for domestic production modelled on recent packages for semiconductor firms and electric vehicle makers, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to media.

The premier also plans to reduce import taxes on key inputs for locally-made goods, which have pushed up India's manufacturing costs, the officials said.

Modi's office and the labour and finance ministries did not respond to Reuters' questions.

Exit polls project that the right-wing coalition led by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will win a big majority when election results are announced on June 4.

Modi's reelection campaign was partly built on the promise of continued economic development. He's pitching India as an alternative for global firms diversifying their supply chains from China.

India is the world's fastest-growing major economy. But that includes both a booming tech sector and a struggling older economy that doesn't provide enough jobs for everyone else, said Josh Felman, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's office in India.

""What can be done now to provide employment - good jobs for these people - is manufacturing,"" Felman said.

India successfully lured suppliers for major U.S. corporations like Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. But less than 3% of global manufacturing takes place in the world's most populous country, compared to 24% for China, World Bank data shows.

The government plans to increase India's share of global manufacturing to 5% by 2030 and 10% by 2047, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. It did not provide specifics.

Reuters spoke to 15 people - including bureaucrats, representatives of major investors, economists and trade unionists - who identified three significant obstacles holding India back from manufacturing hub status: restrictive labour laws, challenges acquiring land, and a rigidly inefficient tariff regime.

INDIA'S PEARL RIVER DELTA?

When Modi was chief minister of his home state of Gujarat between 2001 and 2014, he dreamt up an investment zone in the Dholera region. Legislation creating the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR) was passed in 2009 and local authorities began acquiring land for it in 2013.

The plan, Modi said during a 2011 visit to a Chinese port, was to develop DSIR along the ""Shanghai model"".

Starting in the 1980s, China set up special economic zones along its southeastern coast that are widely credited for it becoming the world's factory floor.

Land reform was a precursor for China's manufacturing rise. Starting in the 1970s, Beijing separated ownership from usage rights, making it easier for investors to acquire industrial land, said Henry Gao, a Chinese trade expert at Singapore Management University (SMU).

Beijing's industrial zoning policies also made it easier for industries to set up in areas with ready access to materials and facilities, he said.

As prime minister, Modi has continued to stress the importance of industrial zones for India. In March, he described facilities under construction in DSIR as central to the creation of an Indian semi-conductor manufacturing hub.

Tata Group announced plans in January to build India's first semi-conductor fabrication plant there. During a visit in March, Reuters also saw construction activity for an upcoming cargo airport and promotional billboards set up by real-estate developers.

There were paved roads and a waterfront but little sign of bustling business.

DSIR hopes to attract more manufacturing companies by providing leases of up to 99 years on government-owned land, said Rahul Gupta, head of the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation.

Local officials have said that it took more than a decade to acquire land and award infrastructure contracts, but Gupta predicted there would be much more activity in about two to three years.

Outside such zones, industrial groups still have to undergo a ""very difficult process"" to acquire the large plots of land they need because title deeds are often unclear and holdings are fractured, said Richard Rossow of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.

In May, Foxconn - whose local investment was trumpeted as a major success by Modi - was met with protests by farmers in Karnataka state unhappy with the compensation they received from local authorities for giving up their land to the manufacturer, Indian media reported.

The Taiwanese company didn't return a request for comment.

LABOUR STRUGGLES

In much of India, firms with more than 100 employees need authorisation from state governments to hire and fire.

This prevents companies from adjusting their operations to meet demand, said Atul Gupta, partner at Bengalore law firm Trilegal.

The BJP-controlled parliament has passed legislation to raise the threshold before official approval to 300, but state authorities that must consent to the changes have stalled the move.

Modi hopes that a strong win on June 4th will give him the momentum and political capital to push through their opposition, the two government officials said.

""No government wants to come across as giving permission to a company to let go of their employees (but)...this is just used to drag out the closure or the terminations endlessly,"" said Gupta, who advocates labour reforms.

General Motors, for instance, decided to shut plants in Gujarat and neighboring Maharastra in 2017, citing low sales. But unions opposed the closures and GM only received judicial approval to exit India completely in January. The U.S. carmaker declined to comment.

To avoid such difficulties, companies end up using contract workers for extended periods, said labour lawyer Amrish Patel.

HSBC economists said that sweeping changes to labour regulations as well as land reforms are needed to sustain high growth.

In a note to investors last month, HSBC economist Pranjul Bhandari wrote that such reforms could allow India to grow at 7.5-8% over the next decade, creating a wealth of jobs.

But lawyer and union leader Sanjay Singhvi said nearly 60% of the workers who benefit from current labour laws would lose protections if the BJP's codes are implemented.

Praveen Chakravarty, a senior economics policy official with the main opposition Congress, told Reuters that labour law decisions should be left to the states. His party's manifesto calls for a review of the labour codes passed by parliament.

TARIFF LAND

Manufacturing costs in India are also elevated because of tariffs on imports, including components for high-end manufacturing.

To encourage smartphone production, Delhi cut import duties on components to 10%. But competitor Vietnam already levies a rate of between 0% and 5% on equivalent inputs, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association.

The average import tariff imposed by India on World Trade Organisation (WTO) members was 18.1%, compared to 7.5% for China, according to WTO data for 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available.

Customs processes are also significantly quicker and less burdensome in China, said Gao.

Imports can clear customs in China in about 20 hours, said the SMU professor. It takes between 44 and 85 hours in India, according to a 2023 government study.

Beijing has focused its efforts on being a key node in the supply chain rather than attempting to own the entire chain, leading to greater efficiencies.

For instance, products exported by China often include inputs from other Northeast Asian countries, said Christian de Guzman of Moody’s Ratings.

But Delhi ""wants to have the entire thing come onshore,"" Guzman said.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is concerned about some of OpenAI’s business dealings, particularly a potential agreement between OpenAI and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Satya Nadella recently met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to discuss this deal involving integrating OpenAI services into Apple products.

Nadella’s concerns stem from the potential impact on Microsoft’s product ambitions, the Business Insider reports.

Apple’s deal with OpenAI will solidify Altman’s control over the company after his brief ouster last fall.

Altman, who has pushed out rivals from the board, aims to replace Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as Apple’s search partner for Safari and build AI chip factories.

However, Microsoft, a significant investor in OpenAI, is concerned about the impact of the Apple deal on its own AI ambitions, according to the New York Post.

Apple considered both Google and OpenAI for this multi-billion-dollar deal.

If confirmed, this agreement would be a significant win for Altman, who has faced scrutiny from former employees and board members.

Tensions within OpenAI have reportedly been brewing since Altman’s brief ouster in November. An insider revealed to The Financial Times that Microsoft pressured OpenAI to prioritize commercial products, exacerbating existing tensions between executives.

Despite these challenges, OpenAI’s valuation has soared to $90 billion since launching ChatGPT.

Altman is considering converting OpenAI into a for-profit corporation to attract significant capital and expand its AI infrastructure.

OpenAI’s annual revenue crossed the $2 billion mark. The ChatGPT parent eyes doubling revenue by 2025.

Microsoft stock gained over 26% in the last 12 months. Apple gained 8%.

Price Actions: MSFT shares traded higher by 0.06% at $414.93 premarket at the last check Friday. AAPL is down 0.14% at $191.03.

However, we recently identified the best Dow stocks according to hedge funds, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) takes the 5th spot on our list of Best Dow Stocks. To view the number 1 Dow stock to buy now, go to 8 Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

On May 17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed out at record highs, crossing the 40,000 milestone for the first time ever. However, this was a little shortlived as the index is down nearly 2.35% since that day, as of May 23. While the index seems to be underperforming the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, it doesn’t fully cover the market conditions like the latter two. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ’s performance is mostly dominated by mega-cap tech stocks, especially NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which isn’t a part of the Dow Jones index.

Dow Bucks Trend, Falls Despite NVIDIA's Upbeat News

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported its first-quarter 2025 earnings on May 22. Despite record numbers, the market failed to rally along with the company. This includes the Dow Jones index as all 30 of its components ended the day in red on May 23, including some of the best Dow stocks that are direct AI beneficiaries such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

In its Q1 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) generated a revenue of $26.04 billion, which was up over 262% year-over-year and surprised the consensus estimates by $1.45 billion. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12, an over 460% increase year-over-year. Moreover, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10 for 1 split, which will take effect on June 7. For the second quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects a revenue of $28.0 billion. The company predicts that the automotive sector will emerge as the leading enterprise vertical within its Data Center division in the current year. At its Q1 2025 earnings call, the company’s CFO, Colette Kress said:

“Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla’s expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption.”

After reporting stellar earnings, NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price crossed the $1000 mark for the first time and was 9.3% higher in a day, at the May 3 market close. Nevertheless, the company failed to rally the market with it as the S&P 500 was down almost 0.75% during the same period, the NASDAQ-composite recorded a decline of 0.4% and the Dow Jones index experienced its worst day in almost 14 months declining by over 1.5%.

Jim Cramer: Celebrating the 40K Milestone

Even though the Dow Jones index is underperforming other indices in 2024, CNBC Mad Money host, Jim Cramer still believes in celebrating its 40,000 points milestone. On May 20, he urged the investors to appreciate the market's progress despite past downturns. Cramer emphasized that while the Dow does not fully represent the market like the S&P 500, it reflects a team effort across various sectors, which should have been demolished by the challenges they faced, such as the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, inflation, and supply chain issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet they thrived. He acknowledged the potential for market declines but stressed the importance of recognizing the achievements of these stocks and companies over the years.

Cramer mentioned that he started as a summer associate in 1983 at Goldman Sachs when the Dow was just over 1000 points, the market was full of bears in multiple sectors but the stock market “left them behind.” He added that the index going from 1000 to 40,000 shows the strength of these companies and that they “will make you money.”

In light of these comments, some of the best Dow stocks include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). You can also take a look at the 15 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.

By Carolina Mandl

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Coatue Management dissolved its stake in Apple Inc in the first quarter while Viking Global Investors built a sizeable new position, securities filings showed on Wednesday. Coatue, founded by Philippe Laffont, had 2.4 million shares of Apple in December, worth $470.6 million. Regulatory filings showed it had dissolved that stake entirely by the end of March.

Apple's shares plunged almost 11% in the first quarter as the company faced fiercer competition in China and falling revenues. Shares in the iPhone maker have pared losses in the second quarter and are now down 1.5% year to date. Other big investors have cut their stakes in Apple. Earlier this month, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had trimmed its position by 13%. Still, Buffett praised the company during Berkshire's annual meeting, saying the iPhone was ""one of the greatest products."" Coatue's filing also showed it reduced its stake in chipmaking giant Nvidia by roughly 68% to 1.4 million shares, or $1.2 billion. Year to date, shares in Nvidia are up 91%.

Coatue also trimmed its position in electric vehicle maker Tesla by 37% to 2.6 million shares. The company's shares are down almost 30% this year amid fierce competition and slowing sales. Coatue, however, more than doubled its holdings in Google-parent Alphabet, to 5.7 million shares. Conversely, Viking showed in the filing a new $663.8 million stake in Apple and a similar position in Microsoft.

The funds' positions were revealed in quarterly securities fillings known as 13Fs. While backward looking, these snapshots show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one of the few ways hedge funds and other institutional investors have to declare their positions. The filings do not indicate exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current holdings.

Both Coatue and Viking are so-called Tiger cubs, hedge funds seeded by veteran investor Julian Robertson, founder of Tiger Management.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett shared his views on success, business advice and life decisions during an interview with Yahoo Finance.

“I’ve said many times that if you get to be 65 or 70 and later, and the people that you want to have love you actually do love you, you’re a success,” he said.

Happiness often correlates more strongly with relationships than with wealth, Buffett said.

Don't Miss:

This Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here’s how anyone can invest for a limited time.

Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women’s health problem at 80 cents per share.

Buffett highlighted the importance of surrounding yourself with exemplary people, saying, “You want to associate with people that are better than you are. I mean, basically, you’ll go in the direction of the people that you associate with.”

Buffett, a man who held the title of world’s richest man for much of the late 1990s and early 2000s, lives a humble and modest life despite his wealth. He bought his house in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1958 for $31,500 and has lived in it ever since. Despite being worth tens of billions of dollars and growing Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to an $800 billion giant, he still regularly eats fast food and drives older, used cars.

Trending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.

Buffett’s approach extends to his diet and routine. He prefers simple, enjoyable foods he liked as a child over health trends, commenting on his dietary choices with a hypothetical scenario where he refuses one more year of life if his diet consists of disliked vegetables.

Buffett advocates for substantial self-investment, particularly in communication skills, which he believes can boost an individual's worth by 50%. He humorously noted, “It’s like winking at a girl in the dark — nothing happens,” to stress the importance of effective communication. If you can't get your ideas across, no matter how good the ideas are, then you're not going to be successful.

In the interview, Buffett emphasized his long-standing investing ideas and strategies. Dubbed the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett is considered one of the greatest investors in modern history, and his strategies have been proven over decades. Buffett emphasized long-term investment strategies over frequent trading, comparing prudent investing to taking care of a car that must last a lifetime.

“All you have to do is just buy across a cross-section of America and hold,” he said.

Buffett has the same strategy for most of his acquisitions and investments. Find profitable, cash-producing companies that have done well over the long term, then invest in them as they continue to do well over the next decade. This has led to massive investments in Apple Inc., American Express and a host of other recognizable names.

The United States stock market has come a long way since the turn of the millennium more than two decades ago. Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times.

Investors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.

The present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.

The fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.

“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.”

Our Methodology

To select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income. The Finance Charts database was then used to identify firms with the best net income growth in the past twenty years. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

While Microchip is not immune from semiconductor cycles, its cash flows have been durable through cycles.

“In the semiconductor industry, demand is closely tied to the economic cycle, and industry order patterns are magnified by its complex supply chain. Furthermore, it’s a capital and technology intensive industry, resulting in frequent overcapacity and product obsolescence. For these reasons, we shied away from any investment in the industry for many years. However, several years ago, we felt that segments of the industry had developed strong enough moats to merit investment under the right conditions. We made one investment (Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) in Large Cap) that we thought was compelling, but it wasn’t until late 2021 when the semiconductor industry entered a severe downturn, that we began purchasing semiconductor stocks in earnest. Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted. Thus, semiconductor stocks in general remain depressed, and our investments have so far shown mixed results.

“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

Bank of America on Apple: A multi-year upgrade cycle for Apple makes the stock a top pick for Mohan.

""Apple reported a strong quarter with many positives,"" Mohan said.

The analyst said third-quarter revenue guidance could be conservative with upside from Apple's Services and Accessories segments.

Mohan sees an iPhone upgrade cycle coming, driven by GenAI. The analyst also said Apple is growing iPhones in China and easing fears from investors.

The analyst highlights the AI opportunity for Apple.

""We expect Gen AI related features for iOS18 at WWDC in June and then at the iPhone event in Sep. We expect Apple to continue investment in its own Silicon and focus on integrating hardware, software and services to fully monetize the Gen AI opportunity.""

Goldman Sachs on Apple: Strength of Apple's Services and iPhone were keys in the second quarter for Ng.

""We gain confidence in our Buy rating with AAPL demonstrating the strength of its ecosystem and allaying several key concerns.""

The analyst said Apple showed improving trends in Greater China, including iPhone growth.

""In our view, F2Q24 provides demonstrable momentum across AAPL's key categories and clears the way to a catalyst-rich NTM including increased clarity in AAPL's generative AI initiatives, new products and ongoing Services momentum.""

Ng said Apple's installed base is ""underappreciated"" and the company's revenue per user could be improved in the future.

KeyBanc on Apple: Artificial intelligence is a key item for Apple going forward, according to Nispel. The analyst is not convinced that consumers will rush out to buy new Apple AI devices like investors believe.

""While F3Q guidance was better than feared, we believe it's more driven by new product introductions in Mac/iPad, as we believe is implied by the guidance iPhone is down MSD,"" Nispel said.

The analyst expects soft upgrades for replacement cycles in the U.S. and increased competition in China to weigh on the iPhone going forward.

""AAPL's user base is growing across products and geographies; its user growth fuels growth in Services, creating an ecosystem that gives AAPL a competitive advantage, which should support AAPL's margin expansion and capital allocation.""

Needham on Apple: Guidance, margins, share buybacks and China were keys in Apple's second quarter results for Martin.

""On China, AAPL stated that iPhone unit sales rose in mainland China vs channels checks of down 13% to 18%,"" Martin said.

One area of concern for Martin is Apple's commentary on generative AI.

""AAPL's GenAI commentary continues to be very weak (our view). Investors we talk to believe that GenAI is the next technology disruption, and AAPL continues to focus its commentary on the last disruption, which was mobile.""

Martin said Apple could be quiet about its GenAI ambitions, but capex spending guidance suggests it isn't increasing spending on the growth area.

The analyst said Apple was the biggest beneficiary of the consumer shift to mobile devices and could be slow in the ""3rd technological disruption cycle.""

DA Davidson on Apple: The second quarter was solid for Apple with a beat on revenue and earnings per share, Luria said.

The analyst is looking for more from Apple coming soon, turning attention to WWDC in June and more commentary on Apple's Generative AI efforts.

""We expect Apple to delivery meaningful announcements surrounding the implementation of generative AI across their ecosystem, which we believe can help catalyze a major upgrade cycle within product categories such as the iPhone,"" Luria said.

Luria also highlighted Apple's Services segment in the new investor note.

""We continue to believe that this growing segment of revenue can help moderate growth for Apple moving forward, with a large user install base that includes over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on their platform.""

Rosenblatt on Apple: Better-than-feared guidance from Apple was a highlight in the earnings report for Crockett.

The analyst said Apple's iPhone sales in China for the second quarter completely brushed off third party research estimates.

""In addition to growth in iPhone in China, Apple is bragging of setting sales record in major emerging markets globally, including India,"" Crockett said.

Crockett said Apple stock is best when it trades based on disruptive innovation.

""The only real investable opportunity is gen AI, where Apple plans announcements for its WWDC in June and can leverage its skill with the hardware/software integration and proprietary neural chips and privacy.""

Crockett said Apple's risk is that its Gen AI efforts are not appealing enough.

Piper Sandler on Apple: Headset concerns were the major item from Apple's second quarter, analyst Kumar is centering in on.

""The primary point of contention for Apple investors appears to be slowing handset growth in China, to which we point out that within China specifically the iPhone segment was down ~8%,"" Kumar said.

The analyst said Apple's quarter strength and reason for the stock being up is likely the Services segment, $110 billion buyback and better than expected results in China.

""Fundamentally we would like to see further improvements in iPhone trends before getting involved.""

AAPL Price Action: Apple shares are up 7% to $185.22 on Friday, versus a 52-week trading range of $164.08 to $199.62.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Markets wobbled at the start of Wednesday's trading session as investors geared up for the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.

According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, it's a foregone conclusion that the Fed will hold rates steady today. And while markets have already priced in the Fed's decision, investors will listen closely to Fed Chair Jay Powell's afternoon speech and answers to reporter questions for further clues about the future direction of interest rates.

SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, slid by a quarter of a percentage point while DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust inched 0.2% higher.

The Fed meeting has grabbed attention from tech earnings. Amazon.com Inc. reported first-quarter beats on both top and bottom lines after Tuesday's closing bell, with the tech giant saying profit more than tripled year-over-year to $10.4 billion. It's shares jumped about 2.5%.

Amazon is the largest holding in XLY, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund, which dropped 0.6% in midmorning trading.

QQQ, the Invesco QQQ Trust which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, slid by half a percent as investors awaited the Fed decision. Tech has gained this year, despite the ""higher for longer"" rate environment. But QQQ has underperformed the broader market, as higher interest rates keep high growth companies like those in the tech sector under pressure.

But while tech might not be keeping pace with the wider market, the Mag 7 is blowing it out of the water. MAGS, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which holds the Magnificent Seven in its fund, jumped 0.4%, boosted by Amazon. MAGS has soared just under 18% so far this year.

MAGS vs. SPY Performance

More tech earnings will be on deck this week as Apple Inc. is set to report tomorrow after the bell. And on Friday, investors will turn their attention to the state of the labor market for the April jobs report.

Any strength (or weakness) in the jobs market will also provide investors with further clues on future path of rates. The Fed uses the jobs data as a proxy for the strength of the U.S. economy since a stronger economy is better equipped to handle higher rates.",0.2554999999999999,0.5428333333333334,Positive,0.508023202419281,0.4877118709711333
AAPL,2025-04-22,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has aggressively recruited dozens of artificial intelligence experts from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, establishing a secretive AI laboratory in Zurich, Europe.

This move comes as the company intensifies its efforts to lead in new AI model and product development.

Apple, valued at $2.7 trillion, has been expanding its global AI and Machine Learning team by poaching many specialists from Google since hiring John Giannandrea as its top AI executive in 2018.

This includes at least 36 experts who have since joined Apple, the Financial Times reports.

In addition to its central AI teams in California and Seattle, Apple has grown its presence in Zurich, Switzerland. This expansion followed the acquisitions of two local AI startups, leading to the creation of the “Vision Lab” in Zurich.

The Zurich team has contributed to research on advanced AI models that merge text and visual inputs, which are crucial for products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple has advertised several generative AI positions in Zurich, maintaining a low profile in the area.

The company plans to showcase new generative AI features at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, potentially transforming the next iPhone into a more sophisticated voice-activated assistant with an enhanced Siri capable of interacting with all apps via voice control.

Apple analysts projected a slight increase in revenue for the March quarter and a significant guide-down for the June quarter compared to consensus, followed by a negative market reaction.

The critical event following the earnings will be Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where analysts anticipate new AI software features will be a significant highlight, with Apple experiencing a relief rally.

Analysts will be closely watching the March quarter for total revenue, focusing on revenue from China (where he expects iPhone shipments to be down 28% year-over-year) and growth in Services revenue, which he projects at 12.7% year-over-year.

Apple stock gained over 2% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK).

Price Action: AAPL shares trade higher by 0.22% at $173.88 at the last check Tuesday.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at American Politicians are Selling These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article American Politicians are Selling These 5 Stocks.

Congressman Michael McCaul from Texas's 10th congressional district is the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. McCaul was one of the leading politicians calling for a ban on TikTok. He authored the bill against the Chinese social media company which the US Senate recently passed, calling TikTok a ""spy balloon in Americans' phones."" President Joe Biden has signed the bill into law that would ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance fails to divest the app within a year.

Congressman McCaul's Purchase of Meta Platforms Gains Attention

But when Congressman McCaul was working against TikTok, he was also busy amassing Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, according to his public disclosures. On March 5, the Congressman bought Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares worth between $100,000 to $250,000 at $490.22 per share. On March 1, he had bought somewhere between 200-498 Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, at $502.3 per share. Analysts believe a ban on TikTok would be a tailwind for US social media companies like Meta Platforms and Snapchat. Because of such overlaps, calls for a total ban on stock trading for politicians have been growing louder. But we aren’t interested in any such bans, since as retail investors any publicly available data showing what insiders are buying is an opportunity. Why? Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.

Stock trades from politicians in the US have always sparked controversies and made headlines over the past few years. In 2022, a Wall Street Journal investigation showed that thousands of officials working across 50 federal agencies were involved in buying or selling of stocks of companies that were directly affected by the decisions of their agencies. The Journal analyzed about 31,000 disclosures of 12,000 officials made during 2016 through 2021.

Do Politicians Beat the Market?

However, the most important question in any discussion surrounding American politicians trading stocks is this: do politicians' stock picks really beat the market? A detailed research by Unusual Whales found that in 2022, out of the 100 Congress members who traded stocks, 33% beat SPY with their portfolios. Another interesting insight highlighted in the report said that Democrats beat Republicans by significant margins. However, there were some anomalies. For example, former House Speaker Nany Pelosi's portfolio, which is often a topic of discussion and is keenly watched by investors, fell about 19.8% in 2022, more than the 18% decline for the SPY.

Politicians' stock picking skills received massive attention during the pandemic days. For example, Senator Rand Paul's wife bought shares in Gilead Sciences just before the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. So what? Analysts were quick to highlight that Paul was part of a Senate health committee that received special briefings from the then government about the pandemic situation in January 2020.

There have been several research reports highlighting instances where politicians used their influence to allegedly profit from different deals. For example a research paper titled “Trading” Political Favors: Evidence from the Impact of the STOCK Act"" talked about an interesting case from 2009:

""Politicians can favor certain groups of firms or individual firms in decisions that have significant economic impact on firm performance, such as the passage of legislations and regulations, the awarding of government contracts, and the selection into government programs. An example can be found in Congressman Tom Petri’s dealings with the Oshkosh Corporation, a manufacturer of specialty trucks and military vehicles. 2 In 2009, Representative Petri helped Oshkosh secure a $3 billion contract from the U.S. Army, after the award was challenged by a competitor and then under review by the Government Accountability Office, by sending letters and memos to colleagues and officials on the Hill and at the Pentagon including the Defense Secretary, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and the Secretary of the Army. Meanwhile, Petri owned a substantial amount of Oshkosh stock, valued at between $250,000 and $500,000, and purchased additional shares as he was making contacts on behalf of the company to resolve the dispute. Oshkosh’s stock price rose from $8 per share in early 2009 to $38 per share in February 2010, when its contract with the Army was finalized.""

Methodology For this article we scanned publicly available data and filings of American politicians and picked 10 stocks Congress members and senators were selling over the past few months. Some top names in the list include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

10. BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15

Congressman Scott Franklin from the Republican Party on March 21 sold a stake worth between $1 million to $5 million in insurance company BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP). Since then through April 24 BRP Group Inc's (NASDAQ:BRP) shares have lost about 8% in value.

In addition to BRP, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are also seeing insider selling.

9. Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 25

Greg Steube, the Republican Congressman from Florida's 17th congressional district, on March 28 sold shares in Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV) worth between $15,000 to $50,000 at $40.06 per share. Since then the stock is down 8%.

8. Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 50

Senator Tina Smith dumped insulin delivery systems company Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) shares on April 4 at $163.25. The total worth of these shares was between $50,000 to $100,000. Since then the stock is up 2.45%. Senator Markwayne Mullin also sold a stake in Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) back in December 2023.

Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), the diabetes management device company, was the second largest detractor to portfolio performance. The company was hit by negative sentiment regarding GLP-1 agonists and their potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on insulin therapy. Type 1 diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, which could offset the lower outlook for cases of type 2 diabetes, but the market ignored this development.”

7. NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 65

NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) ranks seventh in our list of the stocks sold by American politicians in 2024. Senator Tina Smith sold a stake worth between $100,000 to $250,000 in NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) on April 4. Since then the stock has gained about 4.43%. Congressman Rick Allen also sold NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) shares worth between $15,000 to $50,000 back in December 2023.

ClearBridge Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“We added a new position in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), in the utilities sector, which acquires, owns and manages contracted clean energy projects in the U.S. The company was at the center of the defensive stock storm when it slowed its renewable growth outlook modestly in late September, and the stock collapsed almost 30% in less than two weeks. We saw this as an opportunity to invest in arguably the best combination of a regulated utility and an experienced renewable operator with good long-term growth options. Even at a much-reduced estimated growth rate from higher financing costs, which will likely prove to be conservative, our estimate of intrinsic business value is materially higher.”

Like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NEE is also seeing selling from Washington insiders.

6. Boeing Co (NYSE:BA)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 69

Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) continues to suffer amid safety concerns around its planes. The stock is down 34% this year through April 25. Congressman Bill Keating from the Democratic Party on February 8 dumped a stake worth between $15,000 to $50,000 in Boein. He had also sold Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares worth between $1K to $15K on February 28 at $207 per share. Since February 8 through April 24 Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares are down 21%.

Its share price percentage gain over the past five years is double of AMD's and currently sits at 823%. But is Tesla still a growth stock? Here's what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC had to say about the firm as part of its Q4 2023 investor letter for the Large Cap Growth Strategy fund:

Tesla contributed to portfolio performance in the fourth quarter due to our underweight position relative to the growth index. Tesla reported disappointing third quarter earnings in mid-October in part, due to downtime at some factories that were being upgraded. The CEO expressed concern that higher interest rates were impacting demand for automobiles and would not comment on growth expectations for 2024. However, the expected scale production of the Cybertruck is 12 to 18 months in the future which we believe will negatively impact short-term growth.

So, which growth stocks might be great picks for 2024? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and read below for more:

AAPL,2025-04-22,"After a year with of layoffs and activist attention that triggered many changes, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE: SPOT) managed to surpass both top and bottom estimates. Moreover, the streaming giant reported record first quarter earnings as the result of efficient cost-cutting initiatives that also brought significant margin improvements.

First Quarter Financials Shows That A Shift In Focus Paid Off

For the quarter ended in March, Spotify reported revenue rise 20% YoY to 3.64 billion euros, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of 3.61 billion.

As a result of cost-cutting efforts that included layoffs, Spotify reported earnings of 97 euro cents which equate to $1.04, leaving LSEG’s estimate of 65 euro cents far behind as gross margin reached 27.6%.

Spotify ended its fiscal first quarter with 615 million monthly active users, which was 3 million short of StreetAccount’s estimate, but business grew as MAUs rose 19% YoY and 2% from the previous quarter. As part of cost-cutting measures, Spotify also lowered its marketing activity which also contributed to a more normalized growth. Spotify also grew its subscribers 14% YoY to 239 million.

Second Quarter Guidance

For the current quarter, Spotify guided for net new MAUs of 16 million, which would bring the total of monthly active users to 631 million. With cost improvements across its business, the Swedish streaming company also forecasted its gross margin will improve to 28.1%.

First Quarter Was A Victory For Spotify Across Many Fronts

Shifting its focus on strengthening revenue growth and expanding the margin paid off. In addition, the EU sided with Spotify in its epic battle with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the quarter. The EU punished Apple with a historic fine for distorting music streaming competition. Due to a complaint from Spotify, the EU already slapped Apple with an antitrust fine of $1.95 billion in March. This is a big victory for Spotify who started complaining back in 2019 about Apple preventing music streaming services from informing users of payment options outside its App Store. Despite the fact Apple is a tech titan, when it comes to music streaming, Spotify is the dominant one. Fortunately for Spotify, EU regulators are ignoring its dominance and going after Apple instead. Therefore, Spotify had a record profit as well as an epic win during the first quarter that will undoubtedly go down in its history.

UBS Cautions In Tech Sector

UBS Group AG's chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub has advised caution on tech stocks.

Golub suggests that the downturn in tech earnings momentum will be driven by wider cyclical challenges, not by worries about valuations or the industry's prospects in artificial intelligence.

AAPL,2025-04-22,"Last Thursday, the world’s largest producer of advanced processors issued its first quarter results and they were even better than expected as AI demand continues to go strong. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM), whose customers include the AI chip leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) as well as the tech titan Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), expects 2024 to be another year of healthy growth on the back of its technology leadership and broad customer base that also includes Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM).

First Quarter Highlights

For the quarter ended on March 31st, TSMC reported net revenue grew 16.5% YoY to NT$592.64 billion. Net income rose 8.9% YoY to NT$225.49 billion.

The net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, while an industry average is about 14%, reflecting TSMC’s competitiveness.

Nvidia Set To Become The TSMC Of AI

Earlier in March, Nvidia clearly stated its aim to become the TSMC for AI as it continues its expansion beyond hardware, entering into software services. During its annual conference, GTC 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangunveiled new tools. In terms of AI development, Nvidia aims to do for the world exactly that what TSMC does for the AI chip leader by turning its design and concept into physical chips. Therefore, TSMC builds the chips Nvidia, Apple and others need and Nvidia wants to become the AI maker, turning concepts of its clients into a model they get to bring with them.

Second Quarter Guidance

For the current quarter, TSMC is supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, but this strength is partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality. TSMC guided for second-quarter revenue in the range between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. Due to the recent earthquake in Taiwan along with higher electricity costs, TSMC expects the second quarter gross margin to decline by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint. Fortunately, the earthquake that occurred on April 3rd did not cause any power shortages, nor structural damage to the company’s facilities and critical tools such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system. One of its closest competitors, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), lost the lead because TSMC was the first to adopt EUV lithography systems that are essential for its leadership. Although some wafers were affected and had to be scrapped, most of the lost production should be recovered in current quarter, with minimal impact to revenue.

Outlook

With AI demand going strong, TSMC managed to weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand, fueling its stock to new heights. In 2025, TSMC is planning to begin mass-producing its 2-nanometer chips, which come with more power and efficiency compared to its current 3-nanometer ones. As for the full year, TSMC estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to more than double. For the full year, TSMC guided for low to mid-20% revenue growth under the assumption that the AI market continues to expand while the PC market stabilizes, and the smartphone market returns to growth amid an improved macroeconomic backdrop. Although TMSC might not keep the pace with Nvidia in terms of near-term gains due to the fact its business goes beyond chips, it certainly won’t be in a recovery mode like its client, Qualcomm, after the 2023 lulled the smartphone market to sleep. Qualcomm is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter results on May 1st. Best known for making smartphone chips, Qualcomm did surpass estimates with its fiscal first quarter financials and its upcoming report should reflect the business picking up as smartphone sales continue to recover.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Apple Inc plans to invest more than $250 million to expand its regional campus or operations in Ang Mo Kio, Singapore, according to a company statement dated April 17.

Two buildings acquired in 2022, located across from Apple's existing offices, will undergo a major upgrade, the U.S. technology giant said.

""Singapore is truly a one-of-a-kind place, and we are proud of the connection we've built with this dynamic community of creators, learners, and dreamers,"" Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, said in a statement.

Apple opened its first facility in Singapore in 1981 with 72 employees focused on Apple II, its early personal computer.

It has since grown to house more than 3,600 employees in the city-state, which serves as an operations centre for Apple in the region.

Cook will meet Singapore's prime minister-designate Lawrence Wong as well as the city-state's incumbent leader Lee Hsien Loong this week as part of his Southeast Asia tour, Bloomberg News reported earlier on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook will meet Singapore’s leader at the tail end of his most extensive Southeast Asia tour in years, searching for new growth markets and manufacturing locations to offset headwinds in China.

Cook will be in Singapore on Thursday and Friday to meet with Lawrence Wong, who is set to take over as Prime Minister next month, as well as his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the executive’s itinerary isn’t public.

Apple’s CEO is on the verge of concluding a highly public tour that’s taken him from Hanoi to Jakarta, during which he repeatedly stressed the region’s importance as both a market and emergent manufacturing base. His company is looking for growth markets beyond China, a traditional stronghold where demand for its flagship iPhone is sputtering. The company is also diversifying its production beyond the communist country to reduce risks at a time of elevated tensions between the world’s two biggest superpowers.

From meetings with country leaders in Vietnam and Indonesia to interactions with local customers, Cook has filled a lion’s share of his schedule with publicity activities to generate interest in the brand, the people said. Apple has already increased its retail presence and output in countries such as India, and is now seeking to better tap a relatively fast-growing Southeast Asian market with more than 650 million consumers.

The trip could pave the way for a more aggressive sales campaign in a densely populated region where Android phones from Samsung Electronics Co., Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo dominate the market, said one of the people.

As part of the push, the company is getting close to opening the first Apple Store in Malaysia, located in an extravagant shopping complex in Kuala Lumpur. Apple currently operates five brick-and-mortar stores in Southeast Asia, three in Singapore and two in Thailand, according to its website.

The Singapore plans are subject to change, and Apple hasn’t made Cook’s schedule in the region public. Representatives for Apple, Singapore’s Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister’s Office didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Apple, which has operated in Singapore for over 40 years, said Wednesday it plans to invest $250 million to expand its campus in the city-state. The company employs more than 3,600 people there and said the expansion will provide space for new roles in artificial intelligence and other functions.

“Singapore is truly a one-of-a-kind place, and we are proud of the connection we’ve built with this dynamic community of creators, learners, and dreamers,” Cook said in a statement on Apple’s website. “With our growing campus, Apple is writing a new chapter in our history here.”

In the first leg of the tour, Cook met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on Tuesday after pledging new investment in the country. He said Apple plans to buy more components and accessories for its devices from Vietnam’s suppliers, a big boost for the country as it emerges as a global electronics hub.

In Indonesia, Cook told President Joko Widodo Apple is weighing the possibility of making some of its gadgets there. The two also discussed Indonesia’s controversial new trade rule to get more goods produced onshore, one of the people said.

Southeast Asia has become an increasingly important market for Apple because of weak demand in China. The Cupertino, California-based company has struggled to sustain sales in the country since the debut of its latest iPhone 15 series, resulting in a 10% decline in first-quarter shipments. Beijing’s bans on the use of iPhones in government agencies and state-owned companies cast further uncertainty on Apple’s prospects in China.

While India is expected to become a major long-term driver, the iPhone accounts for less than 10% of the smartphones sold there now in part because of its lofty price tag.

HANOI (Reuters) -Apple Inc wants to boost its investment in Vietnam, state media quoted the U.S. tech giant's CEO Tim Cook as saying in Hanoi on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. company said it wanted to increase spending on suppliers in the Southeast Asian nation.

Vietnam is already a key manufacturing hub for Apple and Cook was speaking while meeting Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, state media reported.

Vietnam will set up a working group to support Apple's investment, Chinh told Cook during the meeting, according to state media.

""Today, Apple announced it will increase spending on suppliers in Vietnam, along with new progress in an initiative to support clean water for local schools,"" the company said in a statement released on Monday on its website.

Its spending has already reached some 400 trillion dong ($15.84 billion) and has created some 200,000 jobs, the statement added.

Apple did not respond to a request for additional comments about its spending.

Cook arrived in Hanoi on Monday for the two-day visit during which he met suppliers, students, content creators and users of Apple products.

Apple manufactures iPads, AirPods and Apple Watches in Vietnam and suppliers for MacBooks are also investing in the Southeast Asian country.

The company had 25 suppliers in Vietnam as of 2022, according to its latest suppliers list, the same as in the previous year and up from 21 in 2020. These suppliers include Foxconn, GoerTek, Luxshare, Intel, Samsung Electronics and Compal.

Suppliers to its main vendors, such as Foxconn, are also moving or planning to move to Vietnam, and some are shifting some activities out of China, amid U.S.-China tensions, according to several industry sources who declined to name the companies as the moves were still confidential.

While meeting Cook, Chinh said that Vietnam was seeking support from Apple to develop renewable energy as well as in high-quality human resource training, VTV said in a report.

Apple's latest announcement came days after activists urged the company to take action on Vietnam's detention of climate experts.

Wall Street analysts and wise investors often keep a close eye on insider buying and selling, since academic research has time and again proved that insiders often act as opportunists and make use of insider information while conducting insider transactions. This is especially true for insider purchases, as we have discussed the relevant academic research recently. But what about insider selling? While many believe insider selling is not predictive of anything substantial, there are a few angles in insider selling activity which should not be ignored as they might provide something of value for long-term investors.

When Should You Pay Attention to Insider Selling?

Ben Silverman, director of research at Verity, in his podcast entitled Things All Investors Should Know About Insider Selling, said that there are certain kinds of insider selling activities which are worthy of investors’ attention. Silverman specifically advised investors not to overlook insider selling transactions conducted under the Rule 10b5-1, which allows insiders to sell their company shares by delineating a specific plan, which mentions stock price, amount and transaction date in advance. The analyst said that there has been a misconception in the industry that insider selling under the Rule 10b5-1 is of “vanilla nature” and does not show “opportunistic” tendencies of insiders. Silverman believes some insiders have been using this rule to “sell opportunistically” and some of them have been “very smart about it.”

Important Insider Selling of 2024: Mark Zuckerberg Selling Meta Platforms

One of the examples of such transactions, according to Silverman, is Mark Zuckerberg’s selling Meta Platforms shares under the rule. Zuckerberg started selling Meta Platforms shares last year. He kept selling the stock almost daily, following a pattern. But Silverman said the size of Zuckerberg’s selling increased significantly in February 2024 when the social media company’s shares jumped. Silverman said Meta Platforms co-founder had adopted the Rule 10b5-1 back in July 2023, and at that time he didn’t know at what price Meta shares would be trading in February at 2024.

""But he did have the foresight to prepare for it by setting up Rule 10b5-1 to accelerate selling at certain prices,"" Silverman added.

However, Silverman did say that since companies offer special stock options annually to their executives, insiders usually do not need to worry about their company stock price while selling it. Silverman said insiders can often build up “enormous equity exposure” easily.

Silverman’s point regarding insider selling is also backed by academic research. In a paper titled Insider Trading: Frequency Matters, researchers talked about how many insiders use informational advantage while selling shares under the Rule10b5-1. Here is an important excerpt from the study:

""One US example involves selling shares through preprogrammed 10b5-1 plans, a process that on its face might suggest an orderly series of sales over time, but in reality, is often designed to facilitate large sales at the first opportunity. There is evidence that 10b5-1 preprogrammed selling occurs disproportionately before negative earnings surprises (Jagolinzer, 2008) and can predict share price decline more than insider sales in general (Milian, 2016). Other studies find that selling insiders sometimes appear to work subtly with analysts around the timing of earnings revisions (Richardson, Teoh, & Wysocki, 2004), or otherwise massage earnings accrual information (Kraft, Lee, & Lopatta, 2014), or the timing of share repurchases (Bonaime & Ryngaert, 2013) and earnings restatements (Agrawal & Cooper, 2015) to support a stock price before a sale. There is also evidence that insiders sell well in advance of a default (Beneish, Press, & Vargas, 2012) or bankruptcy (Iqbal & Shetty, 2002), or alternatively, reduce selling ahead of receiving a takeover bid (Agrawal & Nasser, 2012). Not every subtle exit strategy involves selling; informationally motivated share disposal occurs through prepaid forward contracts (Jagolinzer, Matsunaga, & Young, 2007) and large charitable gifts (Yermack, 2009).""

Which Sectors and Industries are Seeing Insider Selling in 2024?

Insider Monkey’s analysis shows that since April 10 through April 15, insiders were dumping technology stocks since the sector had the heaviest concentration of insider selling activity in the period.

Apple drops term 'state-sponsored' attacks from its threat notification policy

In This Article:

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Apple Inc has warned its users in India and 91 other countries that they were possible victims of a ""mercenary spyware attack,"" dropping the word ""state-sponsored"" it used in its previous alerts to refer to such malware attacks.

Apple discovered that attackers tried to ""remotely compromise the iPhone,"" it said in a notification email that was sent to targeted users and seen by Reuters.

The company had previously said on its website that its threat notifications were designed to inform and assist users who might have been targeted by ""state-sponsored attackers.""

But Apple's latest update posted on the website on Wednesday said the threat notifications were designed to help users ""who might have been individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks.""

It also noted that such attacks have been historically associated with state actors, including private companies developing mercenary spyware on their behalf, such as Pegasus spyware from Israeli firm NSO Group.

Apple's removal of the term ""state-sponsored"" from its description of threat notifications comes after it repeatedly faced pressure from the Indian government on linking such breaches to state actors, said a source with direct knowledge.

India's opposition politicians accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government of trying to hack into their mobile phones following Apple's messages in October that warned of ""state-sponsored"" attacks.

Apple held extensive talks with Indian officials before releasing the latest set of alerts, the source added. It was not clear if other governments have also raised similar concerns

Apple and the Indian government did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Mercenary spyware attacks are rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or malware, according to the notification email.

Apple has sent threat notifications such as these multiple times in a year since 2021, the notification email said, adding that it had notified users in more than 150 countries in total to date.

In response to mounting geopolitical tensions, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has boosted its iPhone production in India, reaching an impressive $14 billion in the last fiscal year. This surge signifies a doubling of the tech giant's output, underscoring a strategic move to lessen its reliance on China.

Apple's production escalation implies that now, nearly 14% of the company's flagship phones, or approximately one in seven, originate from India. This information is according to undisclosed sources close to the situation as reported by Bloomberg.

While China continues to be a vital player as Apple's foremost production site and largest international market, there are increasing challenges. These include stiff competition from Huawei and constraints on foreign technology, both of which have impacted Apple's revenue within China.

This boost in Indian manufacturing represents a significant victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration. The government has been actively courting international companies like Apple, offering financial incentives to lure high-end manufacturing to India. As a result, an estimated 150,000 direct jobs have been created at Apple's supplier facilities.

Leading the pack in India are Foxconn and Pegatron, responsible for assembling approximately 67% and 17% of India-produced iPhones, respectively, for the fiscal year ending March 2024.

The remainder of the production is managed by Wistron’s facility in Karnataka, now under the supervision of Tata Group. This facility is on course to establish one of India’s largest iPhone assembly operations. It's crucial to note that the $14 billion figure represents the factory value of these iPhones and not their retail prices.

GRANOLAS Stocks Have Outperformed the Market Since June 2022

This diverse collection of stocks has delivered 60% of the gains in the European stock market in the past year, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, and have outperformed the FAANG stocks for the past two years, Morningstar.com reported.

Plus, most of the stocks on the list deliver dividends of 2% to 2.5%.

They Provide Diversification

While tech stocks tend to fare well in the U.S., a portfolio made up of FAANG stocks doesn’t provide much diversification. On the other hand, the GRANOLAS stocks represent sectors ranging from consumer goods to fashion, technology and healthcare.

They also aren’t tied to the S&P 500 or Nasdaq index. If the bulk of your portfolio is filled with U.S.-based stocks, adding some shares of even a handful of the GRANOLAS could serve you well.

Because of the diversity of the companies on the list, the collection also shows less volatility than the Magnificent 7. “The realized volatility of the GRANOLAS is on average 2x lower than for the Magnificent 7,” Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer recently told SeekingAlpha.com.",0.2318046536796536,0.4068587662337662,Neutral,0.9984105825424194,0.5152092021400603

At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), compared to 64 in the previous quarter worth $1.6 billion.

Here is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”

In its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

“Among our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels.

AI: A Consequential Technology

Artificial intelligence has taken the world by storm. AI has become one of the most exciting things to come out of the technology sector. As a result, some of the best AI stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others, are working the hardest to contribute to the AI race and maybe even lead it, have been attracting even larger amounts of investor attention. This is unsurprising, considering the immense growth AI has been undergoing. On February 14, George Lee, the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Office of Applied Innovation, discussed the growth potential of artificial intelligence, particularly with regard to geopolitics, and how geopolitics, in turn, may shape an AI-enabled future, on CNBC's ""Capital Connection."" Here are some of his comments:

""For me, where I specialize is really this intersection of generative AI and geopolitics. The rise of this new capability in the world is super consequential for countries and for regions, matters of economics, defense, and even culture itself, as Jensen Huang talked about the other day.""

On being asked how he expects machine intelligence to impact global growth, productivity, and the US-China conflict, Lee made the following comments:

""Well, our economists have called for a very significant impact, over a 10-year period, some 1.5% increase in global GDP as a result of this [AI]. Now, I think the important thing to reflect on that is that it's a 10 year interval. While this has arrived abruptly, it's hugely consequential and fascinating, it will take time for this to deepen its impact across economies around the world. And so, we're very focused on trying to monitor that, and I think, my personal view is that there is going to be remarkable productivity and economic gains emerging from this. There's also going to be an incredible leap in human creativity and productivity as we partner with machines just to address and solve challenges that have been prohibitively difficult in the past.""

According to Lee, humanity will likely evolve with machines and artificial intelligence, resulting in exceptional growth moving forward. He noted the following:

""In a sense, I think we will co-evolve with these machines, and look, we are very early days in this new generative AI revolution, but the pace of improvement, the trajectory of improvement, is so remarkable, that I think we do have to think pretty broadly about how we're going to co-exist with machines, how we're going to cooperate, and how, together, we can elevate humanity.""

Global Leaders in the AI Space

With the discussion on AI rapidly gaining speed and importance across the globe, many are beginning to wonder which global players will lead the way in this new global world order that is so heavily impacted by technology and artificial intelligence in particular. Lee gave his opinion on the matter of global leaders in the AI race as well. Here's what he had to say:

""The US and China have an early lead in this. Like other technology revolutions, such as the internet, a lot of this sprang from the US, both academic and commercial roots. China is somewhat challenged in this area, both because they're export-controlled away from some of the key technologies they need, and there's also this issue of the emergent quality of chatbots being somewhat threatening to regimes that are sensitive to social harmony and stability. But make no mistake, they are a formidable adversary and will be leaders in this space. You then have a series of countries, the EU, England, France, etc., who are going to be very consequential here, particularly in terms of regulation. Then you have countries that have a particular technology edge in this domain, those are places like Taiwan, South Korea, the Netherlands. And then, most interestingly, you have countries like the UAE... who have done extraordinary work in building their Falcon open source model, the work they've done around Arabic language foundation models, and just the general infrastructure investing they're doing.""

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will look at the 12 best alternatives to a 4-year college. We have also discussed the decreasing value of college degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.

In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees due to several factors. One major reason is the rising cost of higher education, which has led many individuals to seek more affordable options. Additionally, the job market's evolving nature demands a broader range of skills and competencies, prompting a shift towards alternative pathways such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and online certifications.

However, it's essential to acknowledge the lasting benefits of a four-year college degree. Beyond providing specialized knowledge in a particular field, a bachelor's degree often cultivates critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable across various professions. Moreover, a college education opens doors to a broader range of career opportunities and typically leads to higher earning potential over the long term. In fact, there are easy college degrees that are quite high paying as well.

It is interesting to note that Liberal Arts is one of the easiest 4 year degrees to get. However, Liberal Arts is also one of the most useless associate degrees if you want high-paying jobs.

Moreover, data from the Burning Glass Institute highlights a decline in jobs requiring a college education, dropping from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021. Similarly, Gallup reports a stark decline in the percentage of young adults viewing college education as ""very important,"" plummeting from 74% to 41% within six years.

Companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are redefining hiring criteria, recognizing the value of life experiences over formal education. This sentiment is echoed in findings from Georgetown University, revealing that while a bachelor's degree holder may earn $2.8 million over a lifetime, non-degree holders can still expect $1.6 million in earnings, challenging conventional notions of the economic benefits of higher education.

Moreover, in 2016, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) introduced ""new collar"" roles, emphasizing transferable skills over bachelor's degrees. By 2020, 15% of hires included positions like application developer and cyber security specialist. In 2021, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) eliminated degree requirements for over half its US openings. The P-TECH program aided underprivileged students in acquiring tech skills and securing International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) internships. While International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) maintains lower degree requirements for roles like software QA engineer and network administrator, just 31% of software developer/engineer positions mandate a degree — the lowest among tech competitors per Burning Glass Institute data.

Furthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an average of 12 job changes over a career, emphasizing the importance of adaptable skills garnered from varied experiences. Initiatives such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s career certificates and innovative programs like Minerva University's immersive learning confirm the growing emphasis on experiential learning.

Another observation we tend to find is that inflation, whether in currency or credentials, obeys the principles of supply and demand. Just as rare items like vintage baseball cards command high prices due to scarcity, rare skills in the job market yield high wages. However, the widespread adoption of college degrees as a signaling tool has led to their devaluation. With 99.5 million Americans now holding bachelor's degrees, the once-esteemed credential has become commonplace. This phenomenon, known as credential inflation, sees jobs that once required only a high school diploma now demanding a bachelor's degree. Consequently, many recent graduates find themselves overqualified for low-paying jobs, contributing to underemployment rates. To read about unemployment rates, see the countries with the highest unemployment rates.

Our Methodology

To list the best alternatives to a 4-year college degree, we have looked at alternatives with 4 major traits. Firstly, we tried to include options that offered specialized training or are specific in nature. Secondly, we identified options that provided hand-on experience. Thirdly, we looked at degree alternatives that were largely accessible. Lastly, we selected alternatives that aligned with current industry demands and trends and hence, came with high employability chances. We tried to score each alternative out of a total of 40 on the basis of consensus about the presence of these traits. We utilized Reddit as our primary source of consensus. The list is presented in an ascending order.

By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.

On March 8 Jim Cramer during his program on CNBC said that the latest pullback in AI stocks shows how “fickle” the stock market can be. Cramer said while he is a big “believer” in AI, some stocks in the industry became too hot. While Jim Cramer keeps recommending investors to take some money off the table when stocks run too high, he’s still highly bullish on mega-cap tech stocks and AI plays like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). For example, last week, Jim Cramer advised a caller during his program to “stick” with Meta Platforms. Cramer said that the latest news around TikTok could become a “tailwind” for the social media company. Cramer yet again praised Mark Zuckerberg. Cramer is also advising investors to keep holding Alphabet despite the notion that it is behind in the AI race. Cramer said that he’s holding onto Alphabet because of what the company “can” do instead of what it’s currently doing. He thinks Alphabet has a lot of “optionality.”

Jim Cramer also talked about what he called the “new industrial revolution,” referring to major tech and AI plays. As expected, Cramer yet again highlighted the juggernaut that is Nvidia and said the company’s high performance chips have made it a monopoly in the industry and it would take a long time for other companies to catchup. Cramer said this monopoly was “born” because of “sweat, blood and tears” of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team.

Jim Cramer also said that the AI revolution is giving rise to a plethora of new applications and ecosystems which would help many companies in relevant sectors.

Jim Cramer advised investors to go in a “wait and see” mode and process the upcoming CPI and PPI reports before reaching to any conclusions about the Fed’s possible path in its battle against inflation.

The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office. LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices. Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, the company reported strong fiscal first quarter results, where revenues and earnings beat analyst estimates, driven in large part to growing Al demand. Regarding Intelligent Cloud segment, management noted Azure optimizations were similar to the previous quarter, but new Al and traditional workloads are helping drive greater consumption growth, which resulted in their first reacceleration since March 2022. We believe the strong Azure performance suggests diminishing cost optimization headwinds and growing strength in Al service consumption.”

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”

In 2023, the world's top 20 hedge funds delivered significant returns of $67 billion, tripling the previous year's performance, as reported by LCH Investments in January 2024. TCI Fund Management, headed by billionaire Christopher Hohn, led the group with $12.9 billion in returns after fees. On average, the top 20 managers achieved a 10.5% gain in 2023, surpassing the industry's overall return of 6.4%. Multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, Millennium Management, and D. E. Shaw, known for using leverage, were the top three funds by lifetime gains. Despite representing only 4.6% of the industry's assets, these three firms generated 38.3% of the industry's returns over the past three years. Citadel, with $74 billion in gains since 1990, maintained its leading position in 2023, returning 15.3%, while also deciding to return approximately $7 billion to investors. Pershing Square, led by William Ackman, re-entered the rankings for the first time since 2015, securing the 20th position with $18.8 billion in returns since 2004, and achieving a return of 26.7% in 2023, outperforming the broader stock market. On the other hand, Bridgewater Associates and Caxton Associates were the only firms among the top 20 that posted losses. The strong performance in 2023 followed a challenging 2022 marked by market turbulence due to the war in Ukraine and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The top 20 hedge funds have collectively generated substantial profits, totaling $755.4 billion since their inception, surpassing their total managed assets of $655.5 billion, according to the research findings.

Brad Amiee, Director and Head of Research at LCH Investments, attributes the success of leading hedge funds in 2023 to the impressive performance of the stock market during the year. He noted that in addition to benefiting from the overall positive market conditions, many of these funds demonstrated particularly astute stock selection strategies. In a statement to Financial Times, Amiee said:

“You could argue that, since shorting is such a challenging sub-strategy, keeping things long-biased and having a concentrated portfolio of high quality positions has been the way to go.”

The robust performance of top financiers correlates with the overall stock market rally in 2023, particularly benefiting hedge funds that focus on specific stock picks. Many in the industry have heavily invested in the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. However, concerns are rising on Wall Street about the concentration of investments in these same companies. The data highlights a growing disparity in the hedge fund industry, with the top 20 firms managing just under 19% of the total $3.5 trillion assets but representing 46% of the sector's cumulative gains.

In 2024, global hedge funds are facing pressure to enhance returns due to a robust stock rally and increased bond yields, aiming to counteract investor outflows. Last year, investors withdrew a net $75 billion from hedge funds, following a significant outflow of $112 billion in 2022. Investors, seeking double-digit returns in 2024, are interested in credit, global macro, commodity, and equity long/short strategies. Some potential approaches include adopting ""barbell"" portfolios and exploring bond-trading strategies, given the potential impact of rising rates on refinancing costs for companies. Hedge funds focusing on diverse macroeconomic signals are also gaining attention, particularly as central banks are expected to adjust monetary policies.

Some of the most owned stocks by hedge funds include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 16 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years. You can also directly check the 5 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years.

Consumer markets are dynamic and the introduction of new products represents both opportunity and risk for businesses. Over the past five years, numerous products have faced challenges and ultimately failed to achieve sustainable success in the marketplace. The unprecedented global event, COVID-19 pandemic, disrupted supply chains, altered consumer preferences, and reshaped the competitive landscape, posing formidable challenges for businesses across various industries.

According to McKinsey & Company, nearly 90% of companies experienced supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, significantly impacting their ability to deliver products effectively. Publicly traded companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) reported revenue declines as a result of these disruptions, highlighting the widespread impact on corporate performance.

Moreover, consumer behavior underwent significant changes during the pandemic, with a notable shift towards online shopping and digital consumption. A report by Adobe found that online sales surged by 32% in 2020 compared to the previous year, as consumers increasingly turned to e-commerce channels for their shopping needs. This shift accelerated the adoption of digital products and services while posing challenges for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and physical product-based businesses

In addition to pandemic-related challenges, businesses launching new products faced intensifying competition and higher consumer expectations in terms of quality, innovation, and value proposition. Nielsen research suggests that consumer trust in brands and products has become increasingly influenced by factors such as sustainability, social responsibility, and transparency.

From high-profile tech gadgets to innovative consumer goods, each product faced unique challenges that contributed to the downfall of products launched by many popular companies. For instance, publicly traded companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) faced setbacks with products like Google Pixel 4, which failed to impress consumers and critics due to mediocre battery life and lack of innovative features.

Therefore, Innovation remains a key driver of competitive advantage in today's business landscape. However, innovation without adequate market research, consumer insights, and risk assessment can lead to costly missteps. By analyzing the root causes of product failures and learning from past mistakes, businesses can refine their innovation processes, enhance product development strategies, and better align offerings with customer needs and preferences.

Moreover, collaboration and partnerships with external stakeholders, such as suppliers, distributors, and industry experts, can provide valuable insights and resources to support product development efforts. By fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, companies can leverage external expertise and perspectives to identify potential pitfalls and optimize product strategies.

In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and unprecedented global disruptions, businesses must remain agile, adaptable, and customer-centric to navigate the turbulent waters of the modern marketplace. Through a thorough understanding of past failures and a commitment to continuous improvement, businesses can position themselves for sustainable growth and success in the ever-changing business landscape.

Let's move to the list for the 16 failed products in the last 5 years.

Methodology

Our methodology for identifying the 16 failed products in the last 5 years involved conducting thorough research using Business Insider, Inc., 24/7 Wall St, Listverse, The Verge, and Boredpanda. We selected the 16 failed products in the last 5 years on a structured scoring system. Each product received points based on the times it appeared in the research sources. By employing this approach, we created a definitive compilation of the 16 failed products in the last 5 years and ranked them in ascending order of high scores.

16 Failed Products in the Last 5 Years

16. LG G8 ThinQ (2019)

Score: 1

LG's flagship smartphone, the G8 ThinQ, boasted innovative features such as Hand ID and Air Motion gestures, aiming to differentiate itself in a crowded market. However, these features failed to resonate with consumers, who perceived them as gimmicky rather than practical. Additionally, the G8 ThinQ's design and specifications failed to stand out against competitors offering similar or superior performance at a lower price point. LG's marketing efforts struggled to effectively communicate the device's value proposition, resulting in lackluster sales and market penetration. The G8 ThinQ's failure led to the challenges of competing in the highly competitive smartphone market without delivering compelling innovation or value to consumers.

15. LG Rollable Smartphone (2021)

Score: 2

LG's rollable smartphone prototype, showcased with much anticipation at CES 2021, generated excitement for its innovative form factor and potential to redefine mobile device design. However, LG's sudden announcement of its decision to exit the smartphone market resulted in the cancellation of the rollable smartphone's commercial production. The rollable smartphone, which was poised to offer users a unique and flexible display experience, garnered praise for its forward-thinking design and engineering. However, LG's strategic pivot away from smartphones raised doubts about the company's commitment to innovation in the mobile industry. The cancellation of the rollable smartphone project disappointed consumers eagerly awaiting its release and underscored the challenges of executing ambitious projects in rapidly evolving markets.

14. Sony Xperia 1 (2019)

Score: 2

Sony's Xperia 1 entered the smartphone market with a focus on delivering premium features and a cinematic viewing experience. However, the device failed to gain traction among consumers due to several shortcomings. Despite its high price tag, the Xperia 1 offered lackluster camera performance compared to competitors in the same price range. Additionally, its limited availability through select carriers and retailers restricted its reach to potential buyers. The Xperia 1 also faced criticism for its tall and narrow form factor, which made it less comfortable to hold and operate compared to other smartphones. Despite Sony's reputation for quality and innovation in consumer electronics, the Xperia 1 failed to attract consumers looking for a flagship smartphone with a compelling value proposition, resulting in disappointing sales and market performance making it a failed product.

13. Uber Jump Electric Bikes (2019)

Score: 2

Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s ambitious venture into electric bike-sharing aimed to offer users a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. However, the service encountered numerous challenges that hindered its success. Regulatory issues, including permitting requirements and restrictions on where bikes could be parked, varied across different cities, leading to operational complexities and limited availability in certain areas. Moreover, vandalism and theft of Jump bikes posed significant financial burdens for Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), requiring constant maintenance and replacement efforts. Operational challenges such as battery management and bike redistribution further strained the viability of the service. Despite initial enthusiasm for electric bike-sharing as a sustainable transportation solution, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s struggles with Jump bikes showed the complexities of implementing urban mobility initiatives amidst regulatory hurdles and operational challenges.

12. Google Pixel 4 (2019)

Score: 3

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google Pixel 4 flagship smartphone failed to meet expectations set by its predecessors, facing criticism for several shortcomings. Despite Google's reputation for innovative software, the Pixel 4 disappointed users and critics alike with its underwhelming battery life, which struggled to last through a full day of use. Additionally, the device lacked groundbreaking features to differentiate itself from competitors in the crowded smartphone market. The Pixel 4's high price tag, coupled with its lackluster hardware specifications relative to its competitors, deterred potential buyers seeking value for money. Moreover, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s decision to omit a fingerprint sensor in favor of facial recognition technology received mixed reviews, with some users expressing concerns about its reliability and security. The Pixel 4's lackluster reception underscored the challenges of competing in the fiercely competitive smartphone market without delivering significant innovation or value proposition to consumers.

11. Nintendo Labo (2018-2019)

Score: 3

Nintendo Labo was an innovative concept that combined do-it-yourself cardboard accessories with interactive gaming experiences for the Nintendo Switch console. Launched with multiple kits offering various gameplay possibilities, Nintendo Labo initially generated excitement among gamers and families. However, the novelty of the cardboard construction and limited replay value led to waning interest after the initial launch period. Despite offering unique gaming experiences, Nintendo Labo failed to maintain momentum due to its high price point relative to its perceived value. The lack of ongoing support and updates for new Labo kits further limited its appeal and contributed to its decline in popularity. While Nintendo Labo showcased Nintendo's creativity and commitment to innovation, its failure to sustain interest laid the foundation of the challenges of introducing new gaming concepts into a competitive market without addressing fundamental user needs and preferences.

10. Segway PT (Personal Transporter) (2001-2020)

Score: 3

Marketed as a revolutionary mode of personal transportation, the Segway PT garnered widespread attention upon its debut. With its self-balancing technology and sleek design, the Segway promised to transform urban commuting and personal mobility. However, its high price tag and niche appeal limited its adoption beyond certain niche markets, such as tourism and security. Additionally, concerns over safety and regulatory restrictions hindered widespread adoption of the Segway PT in urban environments. Despite attempts to diversify its product lineup and target new consumer segments, Segway struggled to overcome its image as a novelty or luxury item. The company's decision to discontinue production of the Segway PT in 2020 marked the end of an era for the iconic personal transporter.

9. Google+ (2011-2019)

Score: 4

Google+ was Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s ambitious venture into social networking, aiming to challenge Facebook's dominance. Launched with features like Circles for personalized sharing and Hangouts for group video calls, Google+ initially attracted a significant user base. However, it failed to maintain momentum due to complex user interface and integration issues with other Google services. Moreover, the platform's struggle with identity management and the lack of killer features compared to existing social networks hampered its growth. Security breaches, including one in 2018 that exposed users' private data, further undermined trust in the platform. Despite efforts to revitalize it, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced the closure of Google+ in 2019, citing low user engagement and the challenge of addressing security concerns.

8. Amazon Echo Loop (2019)

Score: 4

Amazon's Echo Loop represented the company's foray into wearable technology with a smart ring featuring Alexa integration. However, the device failed to gain traction among consumers due to its limited functionality and uncomfortable design. Despite offering basic voice assistant capabilities, the Echo Loop lacked the versatility and utility of other Echo devices, such as smart speakers and displays. Additionally, its bulky and conspicuous design made it impractical for everyday wear, limiting its appeal to consumers seeking a seamless and unobtrusive smart assistant experience. Despite Amazon's marketing efforts, the Echo Loop failed to resonate with consumers, highlighting the challenges of introducing new form factors into the wearable tech market without addressing key user needs and preferences.

7. Google Stadia (2019)

Score: 4

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google Stadia aimed to revolutionize the gaming industry by offering cloud-based gaming experiences accessible across various devices without the need for high-end hardware. Promising seamless gameplay and instant access to a library of titles, Stadia generated significant excitement upon its announcement. However, the platform faced numerous challenges, including a limited game library at launch and performance issues such as input lag and latency. Furthermore, the subscription model and pricing structure for games on Stadia were confusing for consumers, leading to uncertainty and hesitancy to adopt the platform. Despite Google's investment in infrastructure and partnerships with game developers, Stadia failed to gain widespread adoption and faced criticism from both gamers and industry analysts.

6. Google Clips (2018-2019)

Score: 4

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s AI-powered camera, Google Clips, aimed to capture candid moments using machine learning algorithms. However, the device failed to gain widespread adoption due to concerns over privacy and limited functionality. Despite Google's efforts to position Clips as a convenient and innovative camera accessory, its reception fell short of expectations. Consumers were apprehensive about the device's always-on recording capabilities, raising privacy concerns in homes and public spaces. Moreover, the device's limited functionality and lack of user control over content creation limited its appeal to consumers seeking more versatile photography solutions. Despite Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s attempt to cater to a niche market segment with Clips, its failure to address fundamental user concerns and deliver compelling features resulted in lackluster sales and market reception.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Greg Taylor, chief investment officer at Purpose Investments, talks with Financial Post’s Larysa Harapyn about which stocks are attractive among the so-called Magnificent Seven, which includes Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., and Tesla Inc., and which ones to avoid.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Roundhill Investments, the thematic ETF issuer with $870.7 million in assets, is doubling down on the Magnificent Seven with a pair of funds, including one for bets the stocks will rise and the other for investors who want to profit on their decline.

The asset manager known for its metaverse and gaming exchange-traded funds launched the Roundhill Daily 2X Long Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGX), which offers twice the daily performance of the famed seven tech equities, by investing at least 80% of its portfolio in equal weight exposure to Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Tesla Inc. The Roundhill Daily Inverse Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGQ) give inverse exposure to the same basket of stocks.

The funds, which began trading today, are designed for ""sophisticated traders,"" the company said in a statement. MAGX dropped 1.6% to $25.15 in afternoon trading while MAGQ rose 0.1% to $24.86.

The seven stocks were coined the “Magnificent Seven” as they largely drove the bull market that started last year. The group makes up about a quarter of the value of the 3,700 or so publicly traded U.S. companies. Fueled by artificial intelligence excitement and the launch of AI products such as Chat GPT, investors bet big on chipmakers like Nvidia and chatbot creators such as Microsoft.

“We saw an opportunity to provide both investors and traders with the full toolkit to express their opinion on the Magnificent Seven,” explained Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer of Roundhill in an interview with etf.com about the new launches.

The launch follows the November conversion of Roundhill's BIGT fund into the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which has not had a day of outflows so far this year, pulling in $106.2 million while gaining 13%, according to etf.com data.

While MAGS is for investors, MAGX and MAGQ is for traders, Mazza said.

“Particularly the 2x version is only appropriate for traders who have the ability to monitor their positions on a daily basis,” explained Mazza.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will take a look at the 25 companies with the best benefits and perks. If you would like to skip our discussion on the global workforce trends, you can go to the 5 Companies with the Best Benefits and Perks.

In today's dynamic business environment, attracting top talent requires more than just competitive salaries; it demands a comprehensive benefits package that will address the diverse needs of a modern workforce. Companies that offer various perks not only enhance their attractiveness as employers but also leverage these benefits as strategic tools for business growth and sustainability.

This is evidenced by the fact that organizations recognized for their superior employee benefits often report lower turnover rates, translating to significant cost savings in recruitment and training. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 56% of US employees consider employer-sponsored health benefits when deciding to stay in their current job. When it comes to identifying the best employee benefits companies, it's important to explore various sectors, including tech giants and manufacturing firms. This helps in understanding how innovative benefits can shape business outcomes and employee satisfaction. The companies that lead in this realm not only offer traditional perks but also prioritize the holistic well-being of both full-time and part-time employees.

Workplace Evolution: Changing Expectations of Today's Workers

A Microsoft survey from 2021 found that 41% of workers globally were thinking about leaving their jobs within the next year, showing how people's expectations from their workplaces are changing. Health benefits are now crucial for employee satisfaction, as highlighted in another 2021 Glassdoor survey where 40% of the respondents said health insurance is the most important benefit. Furthermore, the desire for flexible work is also growing. In a 2022 FlexJobs survey, 56% of participants said they'd consider finding a new job if remote work options were taken away. Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) are adapting to these changing needs of employees by introducing flexible policies.

At Google, a key player under Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), there's significant emphasis on creating a rich workplace culture and extending a wide range of benefits to its employees. This commitment has consistently positioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the top of employee satisfaction surveys, highlighting the importance of employee well-being in achieving organizational excellence. This has also helped improve Alphabet's financial performance, with the company achieving a remarkable 13.49% growth in revenue in the final quarter of 2023. Similarly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also prioritizes employee benefits and is one of the companies with the best health benefits. With perks like healthcare, parental leave, and development opportunities, Microsoft has created a workplace that promotes a positive culture and boosts innovation and productivity. This approach has been vital to Microsoft's ongoing financial success, consistently reaching a market capitalization of over a trillion dollars. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is another company that promotes a deep sense of unity and community among its staff. Salesforce's commitment to its employees is evident in its low attrition rates and high satisfaction scores. With consistent year-over-year growth, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) remains a leader in the customer relationship management sector.

Here’s what Vulcan Value Partners said about Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:

“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the world’s leading SaaS vendor for customer relationship management (CRM) and salesforce automation (SFA) software. The company offers many other products including software for marketing automation, customer service automation, analytics, application integration, and enterprise collaboration among others. During the quarter, Salesforce increased guidance for the fiscal year including higher revenue growth, higher free cash flow growth, and higher operating margins. The company also indicated it is seeing a less measured buying environment and more business opportunities, indicating the macro environment is getting relatively better for them. Salesforce is deeply entrenched within its customer base, has high retention, high recurring revenue, and is a very scalable business with high margin potential. Salesforce is dominant across its offerings and is constantly innovating with new products, features, and artificial intelligence to deepen customer relationships and grow the business.”

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we discuss the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the financial markets and expert outlook, go directly to the 5 Stocks That Will Make You Rich In 2024.

So far, the Fed’s efforts have managed to contain the inflation and is expected to push the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession like the European countries such as the U.K. and Germany experienced.

Last year was another strange year for the market as it was believed that the US economy would go into a recession. However, the complete opposite happened, and the S&P 500 was able to manage gains of over 25%. While it is believed that growth stocks usually perform well during interest rate cuts and have bearish outcomes during economic downturns, the economy was saved by the technology sector, which is dominated by growth stocks. Companies like Nvidia and Meta saw triple-digit growth and are still up 63.63% and 39.78% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of market closing on February 23.

It is important to note that while it is a popular belief that AI and semiconductor stocks were the top performers of the year, it is not entirely true. Blockchain and crypto news were wildly overshadowed by the AI revolution. Some of the best-performing ETFs included Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) and Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI). However, cryptocurrencies have shown a significant amount of volatility in the first two months of the year.

While the Fed has not been clear on its rate-cutting position in 2024, experts believe that it might start in the first half of the year, which means that growth stocks might make you rich in 2024. Although experts still have mixed opinions about the current year, you can still take a look at 14 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Right Now, which also contains a list of stocks with the potential to make you rich in 2024.

2024 Outlook According to Analysts

Even though 2023 was a great year for the market, many analysts believe that the current year might not be as great and should be an average year. It shouldn’t come as a surprise as the news of a soft landing has been spreading around. The “average year” analysis is provided by Morgan Stanley, which believes in it due to normalizing financial conditions, excessive valuations, and a few other factors. The firm suggests maintaining a preference for value stocks as compared to growth stocks at least till the first rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

On the other hand, B.Riley and JP Morgan have quite bullish views about the future of the market. One of their main concerns is the over-valuation of stocks due to the 2023 rally. JP Morgan warns about a potential 20% to 30% dip in the market, while B. Riley Strategist Paul Dietrich predicts a mild recession, which could steer the market toward a 40% decline.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will take a look at the 15 states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024. If you would like to skip our discussion on the US economy, you can go to the 5 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024.

While headlines boast of a historically low national unemployment rate of 3.7% in 2023, there have been massive layoffs totaling 19.8 million during the last year as compared to 17.6 million layoffs in 2022. In January 2024, 82,307 job cuts were announced, which is an increase of 136% from December 2023. Moreover, many different companies across the USA have announced job cuts this year in order to curtail rising costs amid uncertain economic conditions. In fact, a survey conducted by The Conference Board revealed that 23% of the CEOs are planning to lay off employees in the next 12 months. This is 13% more than in the previous quarter.

The brunt of these layoffs is not evenly distributed across sectors. Technology companies, while navigating the current economic uncertainty, are witnessing a significant number of job cuts. In January 2024 alone, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced 5% job cuts in its audiobooks and podcast division, 35% in the streaming unit, and several hundred in the streaming and studio operations. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also announced hundreds of layoffs in the same month. So far, more than 140 companies in the tech space have laid off over 34,000 employees in 2024. In 2023, more than 1,160 tech companies laid off 262,000 employees. The major reason for the significant number of layoffs is the slowdown after the hiring spree within the sector in recent years.

Here's what Baron Funds said about Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:

“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares of Amazon were up 19.5% in the quarter and finished the year up 80.9%. Reported quarterly results were better than consensus estimates with 11% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, a significant beat in North American operating profit as operating margins reached 4.9% and a recovery in the cloud division, AWS, which grew 12% year-over-year and management reported that the impact of customer optimizations was attenuating. We believe that AWS has many years of growth ahead as IT budgets continue switching from on premise to the cloud and as Amazon remains the clear leader in the market, with large incremental opportunities in application software, including enabling GenAI workloads. We also believe Amazon is well positioned in the short-to-medium term to further improve core North American retail profitability to above pre-pandemic levels, benefiting from its new regionalized fulfillment network and its growing margin-accretive advertising business. Longer term, Amazon has substantially more room to grow in e-commerce, where it has less than 15% penetration of the total addressable market.”

Media is another industry that has reported many job cuts recently. In 2023, 20,324 layoffs were announced in this industry. Many big names in media have announced layoffs in 2024, including Business Insider (8% of staff), Los Angeles Times (94 journalists), and Paramount Global (3% of the workforce). The main reason is the rise in popularity of the Internet as a one-stop shop for advertisers. Moreover, consumers are becoming more price-conscious as far as news or informational articles are concerned. Other industries announcing a significant number of layoffs include retail and even automotive. The drop in consumer spending, especially in retail, and the demand for a better bottom line have both led to a drive to cut costs, thereby cutting jobs.

In addition to variation by industry, there is a lot of disparity in the unemployment rate by state. The lowest unemployment rate by state in 2023 was in Maryland, and the highest unemployment rate by state in the same year was in Nevada. In this scenario, unemployment benefits serve as a crucial safety net, providing temporary financial assistance to individuals who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. However, unemployment benefits by state vary significantly in terms of nature and duration, highlighting stark disparities in how different regions address unemployment. Each state has a different methodology for calculating unemployment benefits as well as the employment tax rate, which provides the funds for these benefits.

Our Methodology

To compile our list of the 15 states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024, we made use of three weighted metrics, namely the average weekly benefit (weight of 0.4), cost of living index (weight of 0.3), and the number of weeks these benefits extend (weight of 0.3). We then ranked the worst states for unemployment benefits on all three of these metrics. Then, we computed a weighted average of states' rankings across these three criteria and adjusted the final rankings accordingly. The states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024 have been ranked in descending order of their scores.

15 States With the Worst Unemployment Benefits in 2024

15. Connecticut

Weighted Average Score: 7.2

Connecticut provides unemployment benefits for a period of 26 weeks. The state achieved a noteworthy milestone in economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in November 2023, when employment levels surpassed pre-pandemic levels.

14. Maine

Weighted Average Score: 7.1

Maine experienced an increase in its unemployment rate, reaching 3.2% in January 2024. Despite this upward trend for the fifth consecutive month, the rate remained lower than the overall US unemployment rate and marked the lowest rate on record for the state. However, Maine's unemployment insurance system has faced challenges in meeting the needs of its citizens.

13. Arkansas

Weighted Average Score: 7.1

Arkansas ranks thirteenth on the list of states with the worst unemployment benefits in 2024. In addition to the low cap on unemployment benefits, the maximum duration of the benefits in Arkansas is also short as compared to the standard 26 weeks practiced in many states. The unemployment rate in Arkansas was 3.4% in December 2023.

12. Virginia

Weighted Average Score: 6.8

As of February 2023, the unemployment insurance program in Virginia offers a maximum of 26 weeks of benefits. The benefit amounts vary, starting from a minimum of $60 per week and reaching a maximum of $378 per week. Virginia infrequently revisits its unemployment benefits structure. However, the state has a low unemployment rate, which was recorded at 2.7% in December 2023.

11. District of Columbia

Weighted Average Score: 6.7

In December 2023, the unemployment rate in the District of Columbia was 5.1%, showing a 0.1% increase from November 2023 and remaining higher than other states. The District of Employment Services (DOES) has faced widespread criticism for delays in processing unemployment benefit claims amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to this criticism, DOES has revamped its unemployment insurance benefits system to simplify the application process and address issues related to fraud.

10. Tennessee

Weighted Average Score: 6.2

With an unemployment rate of 3.5% in December 2023, Tennessee is another state with an average unemployment rate and low unemployment benefits. The unemployment benefits in Tennessee are less than the minimum wage. This leaves the unemployed with hardly any money for sustenance.

9. South Carolina

Weighted Average Score: 6.1

South Carolina faces challenges in its unemployment benefits system, not only offering low benefits but also presenting complexities in the application process. With a complex system in place, only 14.8% of the unemployed population manages to access unemployment benefits in the state. Furthermore, South Carolina's eligibility period for unemployment benefits stands at 20 weeks, which is shorter compared to the standard 26 weeks practiced in many states.

8. New Hampshire

Weighted Average Score: 5.8

The unemployment rate in New Hampshire was recorded at just 2.5% in December 2023, lower than the national average. While the state’s economy managed to rebound from the COVID-19 recession in a fairly short amount of time, the rising cost of living has increased the citizen’s hardships.

7. California

Weighted Average Score: 5.8

In California, the unemployment rate rose to 5.1% in December 2023. Approximately one in four unemployment benefits claims were rejected during the pandemic for various reasons. Additionally, California's unemployment benefits have not been updated for over two decades and do not adequately cover the cost of living. Hence, California is considered one of the states with the worst unemployment benefits. Silicon Valley, situated in California's Bay Area, continues to be the largest tech hub, with companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) located there.

6. Delaware

Weighted Average Score: 5.7

In Delaware, a bill was recently passed to improve the state’s unemployment benefits, which have been constant since 2019. As of December 2023, the unemployment rate in Delaware stands at 4.20%, indicating no change from the previous month and a decrease from the 4.60% recorded in 2022. This figure is also below the long-term average of 5.25%.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we discuss the 11 cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence industry, go directly to the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit the ground running since last year, and there seems to be no end in sight to it in the near future. The PwC Emerging Technology Survey suggests that after the launch of ChatGPT, more than half of the surveyed companies have introduced generative AI in some form to their business. The AI stocks also performed quite well in 2023 and are still trending in 2024. The Magnificent 7 stocks outperformed the rest of the S&P 493 heavily in the year, and analysts like Goldman Sachs' David Kostin are positive that the gains will continue in 2024. The seven big tech stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which were the top performers of the group, collectively gained around 75% during the previous year compared to 12% gains for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index.

Other than the big tech, AI technology gave a boost to a range of AI companies. The Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (IGPT) gained over 30% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 25% growth. Moreover, the ETF is also 15.80% higher year-to-date (YTD) at the time of the February 23 market close, compared to the S&P 500’s 7.3% gains.

AI is changing the face of every sector in the market. For example, the mortgage finance company Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE:RKT) uses AI for mortgage banking, underwriting, and servicing. In 2023, The company piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers and outbound client calls.

In addition, the real estate company Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) sets up networks and data centers, making it quite exposed to potential growth in AI computer facilities. At the company’s Q4 2023 earnings call CEO Charles Meyers said:

“We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.

Effects of AI on Labor

An International Monetary Fund (IMF) report defines AI as a double-edged sword. While AI can potentially create many jobs, it can also replace human labor in several other areas. The IMF believes that nearly 40% of the jobs around the world are exposed to AI. In the developed countries, 60% of the jobs will be affected by the new technology creating a higher risk/reward situation for their labor markets. However, the report mentions that wealthier countries are also better equipped to adopt AI.

For emerging economies and under-developed nations, the IMF suggests laying concrete groundwork and infrastructure to be better prepared for the AI revolution in the job market.

The artificial intelligence industry is on the rise, and it’s significantly far away from its peak. This creates some entry points for investors in cheap AI companies. Keeping that in mind, some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024 include Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).

Our Methodology

For this article, we identified 30 stocks trading on NYSE and NASDAQ that directly benefit from the rise of AI or are actively working for the growth of the artificial intelligence space. Next, we chose the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside as of February 23. The analyst price targets were taken from TipRanks. We only chose the companies that were covered by at least two analysts and didn’t have many Hold or Sell ratings, as compared to Buy-equivalent ratings. The 11 best cheap AI stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside.

We also added the number of hedge fund investors for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.

11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Analysts

11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 11.40%

Average Analyst Price Target: $196.65

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) takes the 11th spot on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy. It produces semiconductor devices and its products, including AMD Vitis AI platform, MI300, and Ryzen 8040 laptop processors are driven by and designed for AI applications.

34 Wall Street analysts covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) over the last three months, and 29 maintained a Buy rating on the stock. As of the February 23 market close, the average price target of $196.65 represented an upside of 11.40%.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, along with Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.95%

Average Analyst Price Target: $206.15

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is famously known for its signature consumer electronics and more, but it has been working tirelessly to integrate AI and machine learning into its products.

On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable by February 15 to the shareholders of record on February 12. The stock’s dividend yield was 0.53% as of the February 23 market close.

In the first quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a GAAP EPS of $2.18, surpassing the analysts’ estimates by $0.07. The revenue jumped 2.1% year-over-year (YoY) to $119.6 billion, topping the estimates by $1.34 billion.

Mairs & Power mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“The Fund’s relative performance was negatively impacted by what we didn’t own as well. In particular, not holding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for most of the year cost the Fund more than 300bps (basis points) of performance. Apple may be the best-known company in the world and its seemingly ubiquitous iPhone holds a dominant share of the global cell phone market. Apple is even more dominant among Millennials and Gen Zers, which should lead to even greater market share as these cohorts age. This loyal user base should pay huge dividends for shareholders as Apple continues to monetize this ecosystem, especially as the company delves deeper into services, payments, and AI. We initiated a position in Apple during the fourth quarter and await a more attractive entry point to add to our position.”

9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.33%

Average Analyst Price Target: $164.59

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 214

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest tech holding companies and has many AI-driven products under its belt, including Bard, Gemini 1.5, and more.

First Pacific Advisors stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”

8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.44%

Average Analyst Price Target: $469.58

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 302

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been long making headlines in the AI industry with its investments in AI companies and AI products like Azure AI.

On February 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith took to Twitter and announced that the company would be investing $2.1 billion over the next two years to develop the AI infrastructure in Spain.

On February 15, it was reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning on furthering the AI infrastructure in Germany through an investment of 3.2 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in the next two years.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was mentioned in Baron Funds’ fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Our biggest purchase in the fourth quarter was a new position we initiated in the software platform Microsoft Corporation. While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund, we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy. However, Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric, on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers. Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly. Over time, Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share, while becoming a more important driver for the company. For example, in the last quarterly earnings release, Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors. A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year. Just to put this in perspective, $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business, it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue. We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner, global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $4.7 trillion worldwide IT spending.

7. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)

Average Analyst Price Target Upside: 17.66%

Average Analyst Price Target: $122.30

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20

Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a California-based company that designs and sells user interface solutions, and many of them are integrated with AI, like its Smart Home SoC solution. It ranks seventh on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.

On February 9, Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy raised the price target on Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)’s stock to $130 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.

On February 8, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) released its Q2 earnings result with a non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, which beat the estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $237 million topped the estimates by $1.33 million.

TimesSquare Capital Management made the following comment about Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:

“In the Information Technology sector, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) develops and markets semiconductor product solutions. Their products enable users to interact more easily with smartphones, notebooks, tablets, and other portable multi-media devices. While the fiscal third quarter results were in line with sell-side projections, forward guidance was worse than expected. Management sees growing macroeconomic headwinds further impacting IT budgets, and the inventory draw-down has been slower than they had anticipated on weaker sell-through trends. Synaptics lost -23% and we added to the position.”

6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) are some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, besides Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).

Polen Capital commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

As we navigate through 2024, the outlook for both the stock and bond markets experiences regular fluctuations, driven by a myriad of factors including economic data releases, Federal Reserve communications, and shifts in interest rate forecasts. Initially, investors anticipated multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve over the year, with expectations of the first cut occurring in March. However, in light of a string of favorable economic indicators, the Fed has signaled that a rate cut in March is unlikely. As a result, investors are recalibrating their assessments of stocks and bonds, anticipating fewer rate cuts to commence at a later date than previously anticipated.

The Commerce Department's report on economic growth reveals a 3.1% year-over-year expansion in the fourth quarter of 2023, fueled by robust consumer spending in sectors like healthcare, dining, and automobiles. This robust performance, combined with potential future rate cuts, has bolstered market sentiment, with bulls expressing optimism and setting higher targets for the S&P 500 index. Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, suggested that the S&P 500 could reach 6,100 in the long term if new highs are reached. Despite certain stocks being overbought, Stockton highlighted signs of market strength, signaling the start of a bull market.

On a contrasting note, analysts with a long-term perspective anticipate that the Federal Reserve will eventually commence rate cuts. At the same time, robust earnings growth and economic resilience will propel the S&P 500 upward towards the end of 2024. Goldman Sachs has recently revised its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,200, an increase from its earlier projection of 5,100. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs anticipates that the robust earnings performance of mega-cap stocks, particularly those within the Magnificent Seven group, will play a significant role in driving S&P 500 profits in 2024.

Given the circumstances outlined above, it’s no wonder that renowned companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remain top contenders as some of the best revenue stocks to invest in, both in the eyes of analysts and investors.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google has told suppliers to start making its Pixel smartphones in India by next quarter at the earliest, as part of its plan to ship more than 10 million Pixel phones this year, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday.

Google would start manufacturing smartphones in India and its flagship Pixel 8 will be available in 2024, it said last October, as it focuses more on a key growth market.

The move will also help Google diversify its supply chain away from China, the Nikkei report said, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

The tech giant will prepare production lines for its high-end Pixel 8 Pro smartphones in the coming weeks and start producing phones in the April-June quarter, the report added, citing multiple sources.

The report did not say how many phones Google plans to manufacture India nor if the phones will be for sale in the country or for exports.

Google did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Microsoft is the world largest company in terms of market cap, according to a new study.

CEOWORLD Magazine recently ranked the world’s largest companies by market cap, which refers to the total dollar market value of a company’s outstanding shares of stock. Among the largest companies were Microsoft ($3 trillion market cap), Apple ($2.87 trillion market cap), Saudi Arabian Oil Company ($2 trillion market cap), Amazon ($1.87 trillion market cap), and Alphabet Inc.

Several U.S. companies from last year’s list still maintained top rankings in this year’s list. Apple, which ranked number one last year, fell to number two this year. Microsoft, which ranked number two last year, secured the top spot this year.

A number of companies made this year’s top 25 that weren’t on last year’s ranking. Home Depot, Adobe, Chevron, and Salesforce all secured spots in this year’s top 25.

Overall, the ranking includes companies from 12 different countries, including the United States, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Denmark, and France. The total revenue for the entire CEOWOLRD 50 Global stands at $29.63 trillion – the equivalent of 6.7 times Germany’s GDP.

Top 15 MBA Interview Questions, According to Experts

Securing an MBA interview is a huge accomplishment—and often it means you’re close to the finish line.

“While some MBA programs interview all applicants, in most cases getting asked to interview is a sign that your application and profile are compelling, and the admissions committee can see a potential place for you in the upcoming class,” Erin Wand, an admissions consultant at mba.com, says.

Preparing for your interview beforehand is key to success. The experts at simplilearn recently compiled a list of the top MBA interview questions that admissions officers use to determine whether or not you are the right fit for their B-school.

“TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF”

This question is usually asked as a conversation starter to better understand your background, experience, and accomplishments. Try to limit your response to two to three minutes and prepare essential talking points beforehand including: Your undergraduate experience and why you chose the major that you did, work experience and accomplishments from the past and present, and your career objectives.

“WHAT MOTIVATES YOU TO PURSUE AN MBA?”

With this question, admissions officers are trying to see whether or not you have a well-thought-out approach to your MBA journey. Explaining the “why” is key to answering this question clearly.

“Explain why you want to get a master's degree in business administration and how it will help you reach your career goals,” according to simplilearn. “Emphasize the precise talents you want to develop and how they relate to the field, job function, or sector you're interested in. What prompted you to pursue this degree at this time?”

“WHY THIS BUSINESS SCHOOL?”

Nearly every interview will include a “why our school” question. Experts recommend crafting your response in a way that demonstrates your fit with the B-school and its culture and offerings.

“Mention your achievements, emphasize the abilities you've developed so far in your career, and explain how your academic and professional experience will benefit others in the program,” according to simplilearn.

It can also be beneficial to highlight direct opportunities at the B-school that align with your goals.

“Tell the admissions committee or interviewer what classes and majors interest you, and why,” Stephanie Horn, an admissions consultant at Admissionado, says. “Show them you have gone beyond the school landing pages to really dig into how you can customize your classes to meet your unique needs and future goals.”

“WHAT WOULD YOUR CO-WORKERS, SUPERVISOR, OR FRIENDS SAY ABOUT YOU?”

This personality question is designed to better understand your professional and personal traits. Experts recommend utilizing points from your letter of recommendation to paint an authentic picture of who you are.

“It's most likely the person who wrote your letter of recommendation, if they say, supervisor,” according to simplilearn. “As a result, avoid making things up because any inaccuracies may create suspicion.”

TOP 15 MBA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

Tell me something about yourself

What motivates you to pursue a graduate business degree?

Why do you want to join this business school?

Why should we take you in?

Discuss your achievements as a leader

What are your strengths and weaknesses?

What aspects of your current job do you enjoy?

What are your immediate and long-term objectives?

How would an MBA help you advance in your career?

How to Write the GMAT Essay

Despite the Analytical Writing Assessment not contributing to your total GMAT score, it does play a subtle role in your admissions criteria.

“While AWA may not explicitly help your case, a low AWA score definitely acts as a deterrent, scoring less than 4 on the GMAT essay can damage your chances of admission to top business schools,” says Manan Kumar, of ENZ PREP.

Erika Väätäinen, an admissions consultant at mbaMission, recently broke down the importance of the GMAT essay and offered an organizational framework for applicants to follow.

BRAINSTORM

First and foremost, start by reading the essay prompt carefully. In many ways, the prompt will look and feel just like the Critical Reasoning arguments of the GMAT.

“The argument will most closely resemble Assumption Family arguments, so find the conclusion and make sure you understand how the author is trying to support their conclusion,” Väätäinen says. “Next, brainstorm any assumptions that you can think of and jot these down.”

After brainstorming, start articulating the flaws in the argument—pick two or three to form the basis of your essay.

“Any assumptions are automatically flaws, because the author has not established that those assumptions are, in fact, true,” Väätäinen says. “You may also think of other flaws along the way.”

FIRST PARAGRAPH

Your first paragraph should summarize the conclusion of the given argument in one to two sentences and contain your thesis.

“The thesis is typically one sentence and conveys to the reader your overall message or point for the essay that you wrote,” Väätäinen says. “For the argument essay, you can write most of your thesis sentence before you get to the test! You already know that the argument will contain flaws, and that you will be discussing how those flaws hurt the author’s conclusion. Guess what? That is always your thesis.”

BODY PARAGRAPHS

Dedicate each body paragraph to a flaw. In each paragraph, Väätäinen recommends including the following:

Introduce one flaw (Do not repeat the exact language from the prompt)

Explain why it is a flaw (JHow does this make the conclusion less likely to be true?)

Suggest ways to fix the flaw (you are fixing the flaw, not changing the conclusion; what could the author do to strengthen their argument?)

“For example, let us say that an argument claims that firing half of a company’s employees will help the company to reduce costs and therefore become more profitable,” Väätäinen says. “What is the conclusion, what supports that conclusion, and what assumptions is the author making?”

CONCLUSION PARAGRAPH

Using different words, your conclusion paragraph should restate your thesis, reacknowledge the other side, and briefly summarize how your examples support your thesis. Väätäinen recommends keeping your conclusion paragraph to three to four sentences max.

“Basically, the conclusion paragraph is not going to contain much new information,” Väätäinen says. “It is a conclusion; the major points should already have been made earlier in the essay. What you are doing now is tying everything together in one neat package.”

Late last year, investors flocked to Treasuries amid expectations of rate cuts by the Fed as early as the first quarter of this year. This surge in demand caused government bond prices to rebound sharply from 16-year lows. However, many investors are now reassessing their positions following robust U.S. jobs data and a cautious tone from the Fed, with the central bank recently warning that a strong economy could lead to inflationary pressures if rates are reduced prematurely. While investors still anticipate multiple rate cuts this year, there is now greater uncertainty regarding the timing and extent of the Fed's monetary easing measures.

That said, investors would do well to recall that the NASDAQ Composite experienced a sharp decline of over 33% in 2022 amid concerns of a recession. Even during the pandemic-induced volatility of 2020, characterized by surges in tech-heavy growth stocks, the index closed the year with an impressive gain of nearly 44%. It appears that this positive momentum is carrying into 2024, with many investors maintaining confidence in their tech holdings and anticipating further profitability as the year unfolds. The latest growth indicators suggest that the index is poised for another record-setting year in the market.

On February 1, Farzin Azarm from Mizuho Americas discussed current trends in the US tech sector and investors' continued focus on tech stocks during an appearance on CNBC. Azarm suggests that the persistent favoritism towards US tech stocks is leading to a disregard for stocks from other regions, particularly those from China. He posits that a significant shift in the US tech and AI sectors is necessary to redirect investment interest towards Chinese stocks. Azarm notes that investors, having already allocated substantial funds to pricey American stocks, are hesitant to further invest in similarly expensive companies.

Given the circumstances outlined above, it's no wonder that renowned companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remain top contenders as some of the best American stocks to invest in, both in the eyes of analysts and investors.

In December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.

The market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.

The trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.

Despite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.

To benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”

10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 102

Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11.

“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

During Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.

White Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.

“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”

“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026.

By Zeba Siddiqui

(Reuters) -Internet giant Google on Tuesday called out a series of surveillance software companies that it said were enabling the use of dangerous hacking tools, and urged the United States and its allies to do more to rein in the spyware industry.

Spyware firms often say their products are meant for the use of governments for national security. However, the technology has been repeatedly found to have been used to hack into the phones of civil society, political opposition and journalists in the last decade. The industry has faced increasing scrutiny since the Israeli firm NSO's Pegasus spyware was found on the phones of various people globally, including human rights defenders.

In a report on Tuesday, Google researchers said that while NSO is better known, there are dozens of smaller firms helping the proliferation of spy technology for malicious uses.

The findings by Alphabet Inc's Google are significant because the company has some of the best visibility into hacking campaigns globally, given the vast breadth of its online offerings.

""Demand from government customers remains strong and our findings underscore the extent to which commercial spyware vendors have proliferated hacking and spyware capabilities that weaken the safety of the Internet for all,"" researchers from Google's TAG threat-hunting team said in the report.

""The private sector is now responsible for a significant portion of the most sophisticated tools we detect.""

The United States and several of its allies committed last year to work toward curbing the surveillance software industry, after at least 50 U.S. government employees in 10 countries were found to have been targeted by spyware.

The Google researchers named a roster of firms that offer a range of services to break into phones, and have been evolving to bypass the latest security measures by Apple and Google for their phone operating systems iOS and Android.

They include the Italian firms Cy4Gate and RCS Labs, Greek company Intellexa, and the lesser-known Italian company Negg Group and Spain's Variston.

Negg Group’s website says the company is focused on cybersecurity, but Google said its software was found to have been used to spy on people in Italy, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan.

Variston made software that infected user’s devices via the browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or iOS apps, Google said, adding that another company, Protected AE -- also known as Protect Electronic Systems -- used a similar targeting technique.

The five companies either did not respond to requests for comment, or were not reachable.

The Google report comes a day after the United States announced a new visa restriction policy for those it said were misusing commercial spyware, allowing the placing of restrictions on individuals believed to have been involved in the abuse of commercial spyware, as well as for those who facilitate such actions and benefit from it.

""Limiting spyware vendors' ability to operate in the U.S. helps to change the incentive structure which has allowed their continued growth,"" Google said in a statement.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) continue to be considered some of the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts and investors alike. These companies are some of the best long-term tech stocks to invest in and have been dubbed the best tech stocks to buy for several years, all due to their stellar performance. But they have been joined by many other notable names, which our list below will highlight.

Our Methodology

We have selected the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts by using a stock screener to identify American tech stocks and then shortlisting the top stocks based on their upside potential according to Wall Street analysts. The stocks are ranked from the lowest to the highest upside potential as of February 5. We have also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock. Some leading companies, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), had to be excluded from our list because of their low upside potential.

Upslope Capital Management mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global equity markets rebounded on Thursday on expectations that interest cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks were coming, though not as soon as hoped for, while Treasury yields slid again on concerns about regional U.S. banks.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday pushed back on market speculation that rates would be cut in March, sparking a sell-off on Wall Street that lingered into Thursday until investors turned their focus to corporate earnings.

MSCI's index of equity performance in 47 countries at first seesawed but later rose as investors looked ahead to results from megacap stars Apple, Amazon.com and Meta Platforms after the bell.

A number of investors already had discounted the narrative that many rate cuts were on the horizon, said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""To most investors the important thing is the trend that rates are likely headed lower, even if it's not as quickly as some would like,"" Meckler said, adding the focus is now on earnings and whether megacap results can support their prices.

Apple's iPhone sales are expected to show the best growth in five quarters, but analysts see a tough year for the company in China. Traders are eager to see if Amazon can cash in on its delivery heft by boosting fee revenue from its ""Buy With Prime"" service.

MSCI's all-country world index closed up 0.67%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.97%, the S&P 500 added 1.25% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3%.

Futures have pared bets for a rate cut in March to 37.5% from almost 90% at year-end 2023, but increased the likelihood of a cut or two to 96% when the Fed meets in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.

The Fed's inflation fight got a boost on Thursday, with data showing U.S. worker productivity grew more quickly than expected in the fourth quarter to keep unit labor costs contained.

Labor Department data also showed job market momentum is slowly fading, which could help to curb wage inflation. Other data showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose to a two-month high last week.

The dollar fell against the euro and yen, while sterling rebounded after a Bank of England meeting that sought more evidence of slowing inflation before it would cut rates.

The dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.52%. The euro rose 0.48% to $1.0868, the yen strengthened 0.32% to 146.42 per dollar and sterling was at $1.2744, up 0.47% on the day.

Euro zone inflation eased as expected last month but underlying price pressures fell less than forecast, likely boosting the European Central Bank's argument that rate cuts should not be rushed.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.37%.

Treasuries rallied strongly, with 10-year yields slipping 10 basis points to 3.865%, amid jitters over regional U.S. banks after shares of New York Community Bancorp fell further on concerns about commercial real estate.

The KBW Regional Banking index fell 2.28%.

""If we didn't have the issue with New York Bancorp, where concerns about tight credit conditions clearly affected the profitability of that bank, then we would probably be talking about a different story for rates,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of fixed currency strategy Amundi US in Boston.

Asian markets were choppy overnight. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose 0.2%, helped by Chinese blue chips that snapped a four-day slide, along with better surveys on home prices and manufacturing.

Japan's Nikkei eased 0.8% as the yen gained.

Oil prices fell more 2% after false market speculation that Israel agreed to a Gaza ceasefire. A Qatar official told Reuters that Hamas has received a ceasefire proposal positively, but it has not yet responded to it.

Brent crude futures plummeted $1.85 to settle at $78.70 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $2.03 to settle at $73.82.

Gold firmed nearer a one-month high after data showed U.S. weekly jobless claims rose last week.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we take a look at here is how billionaire Chris Hohn's hedge fund beat the market with 33% gain and his top 9 stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion of Hohn's investment philosophy, his fund's performance and go directly to Here is How Billionaire Chris Hohn's Hedge Fund Beat the Market with 33% Gain and His Top 5 Stock Picks.

Founded in 2003 by billionaire investor Chris Hohn, the TCI Fund Management was up 32.7% in 2023, recouping a significant chunk of the losses accrued in 2022. The hedge fund was down by about 18% in 2022 as the S&P 500 fell 19% at the height of a ferocious market sell-off triggered by a significant spike in inflation and a push by the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates.

TCI Fund Management had one of the best years in 2019 as it returned $8.4 billion worth of net gains, providing a 41% return against an average hedge fund return of 10.35%. It returned 14% at the height of the COVID 19 pandemic in 2020. Likewise, it outperformed the overall sector as equity hedge funds gained 6.65% on average in 2023 against its 32.7%, benefiting from solid gains in the technology sector.

Hohn founded the hedge fund with his ex-wife, Jamie Cooper Hohn, with the sole aim of transforming the lives of children and adolescents. Consequently, the hedge fund manager donates 50 basis points of the management fees to the fund to help fund various charitable initiatives. In addition, the fund also finances various causes, including climate, sexual & reproductive health, aimed at improving the health and lives of girls all over the world.

TCI Fund Management has been growing in strength since it bounced back from a 43% drawdown amid the global financial crisis in 2008. It has generated, on average, 18% in annualized gain since inception, more than double the return of the S&P 500 index over the same period. The gains have come on Hohn running mostly long only and a very concentrated global portfolio of stocks.

TCI Fund Management 's performance in 2023 affirmed Hohn's stock-picking skills that have always allowed him to outperform the overall market. The hedge fund has posted profits for 13 straight years through 2021. It only lost money when it went down by 18% in 2022 as its investments in Alphabet and Microsoft turned sour amid a broader sell-off in the tech sectors.

In 2023, it was a different ball game as TCI Fund Management benefited from its exposure to high-growth stocks that exploded at the height of the bull run. Its biggest holdings were all up by more than 25% for the year, helping propel TCI Fund Management to stellar gains in 2023.

The hedge fund also benefited from the diversification strategy that Hohn has always relied on to generate returns in the market. Over the years, Hohn has always emphasized investing in various industries, including manufacturers, consumer products companies, and even banks. While the services sector accounts for the biggest share of TCI Fund Management holdings, the fund is also heavily invested in technology and health care.

Chris Hohn

Hohn is also known for his relentless efforts in pushing companies to make strategic changes to improve performance and returns. He occasionally spearheads activist campaigns whenever he believes a stock is trading below its intrinsic value. One of his most recent activist campaigns was at Alphabet, where he penned a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai asking the executive to initiate structural changes in the push to cut back on expenses and reduce headcount.

It is still unclear whether Hohn’s activist campaign letter prompted Alphabet to embark on a restructuring drive. Concerned by soaring pressure amid artificial intelligence threats mostly spearheaded by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) took drastic changes that involved laying thousands of workers.

The tech giant also bolstered its investments in artificial intelligence, resulting in the launch of AI-powered chatbot Bard. Amid the efforts, Hohn also pushed Alphabet to consider decreasing salaries as one of the ways of clamping down on expenses as competition for talent in the industry has subsidized significantly.

Airbus is another company that has felt the full brunt of Hohn activists' campaigns. In February of last year, the billionaire investor wrote a letter urging the company to terminate ongoing negotiations over the purchase of a minority stake in Evidian.

With about $4.3 billion worth of stakes in Airbus, the billionaire reiterated the investment would only be value-destructive. While Airbus shrugged off the activist campaign and went ahead with the deal, it ultimately fell apart amid regulatory hurdles.

Disclosure: None. Here is How Billionaire Chris Hohn's Hedge Fund Beat the Market with 33% Gain is originally published on Insider Monkey.",0.1126798688640794,0.3827015771752614,Positive,0.9987634420394896,0.4551709099881657
GOOGL,2025-04-22,"""What I learned at business school was that Silicon Valley was the center of the creation of the internet industry… It seemed crazy to go back to New York."" Kacher once told Forbes.

The Silicon Valley insights help guide Kacher’s long and short investment strategies. For example, he takes long positions in industry disruptors and shorts the incumbents. After learning that business travelers preferred ride-hailing services like Uber to traditional rental car services, Kacher went about shorting rental car stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) and made good money out of it.

Also, Kacher shorts auto parts stocks because he believes that the rise of ride-sharing and electric cars will reduce consumer demand for auto parts.

As with all other hedge funds, Kacher’s Light Street Capital has had its hits and misses. There are years that it has delivered outstanding returns and years when it has suffered overwhelming losses.

From 2010 through 2017, Light Street’s annualized net returns stood at 19.8%. In 2017, the fund delivered returns of 38.6%. In 2018, its returns improved to 53% in the first 10 months of the year.

But 2021 and 2022 turned out to be punishing years for Kacher. His hedge fund lost 26% in 2021 and things only got worse in 2022 when the fund lost 54%. In 2022, soaring inflation, Russia’s war with Ukraine and rising interest rates combined to hurt technology companies. That dealt a heavy blow to tech-focused hedge funds such as Light Street Capital.

Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital

But the fund made a strong comeback in 2023, returning 46%. In 2023, tech stocks benefited from AI excitement, which led to the blockbuster returns at Light Street Capital.

The AI theme is expected to continue impacting tech stocks in 2024. In a recent interview with CNBC, Glen Kacher spoke about AI being a multi-decade opportunity.

While there will no doubt be ups and downs, the hedge fund boss noted that AI presents a huge tailwind and opportunity for investors. He sees the AI impact on technology companies being as massive as the previous major technology shifts, such as the shift from PCs to networks or SaaS software.

Kacher believes that AI presents a massive opportunity for the leaders in the technology sector and that AI is an incredible opportunity for investors to deploy their capital behind.

As to the best way for investors to get exposure to AI opportunities, Kacher believes that semiconductor stocks present a good opportunity. He notes that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the chip companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI.

Software companies are also great opportunities, according to Kacher. The hedge fund boss said that Magnificent Seven companies are best-positioned to ride the AI trend. He noted that these are companies with customers, massive data and massive amounts of capital.

AI is going to be a big deal for the tech industry in 2024. In Davos, industry experts spoke about 2024 being a potentially big year for AI. They noted that 2023 was the year of discovery when AI proved its ability and that 2024 will be the year when focus will be on improving the technology’s reliability so that those adopting it can be more comfortable with it.

Apart from AI continuing to attract more money to the technology stocks, the economic outlook also looks promising for tech companies. The Fed appears to have succeeded in cooling off inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Technology companies tend to thrive in an environment of low interest rates as borrowing becomes cheap and obtaining capital becomes easy.

Amid the continuing AI excitement and growing optimism over economic outlook as inflation cools and the Fed contemplates rate cuts, stocks are soaring in 2024 with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in January.

In its latest 13F filing, Light Street Capital revealed large stakes in semiconductor stocks that are expected to benefit from AI-fueled demand. The filing also shows that the fund remains heavily invested in software companies that develop AI tools or stand to benefit from integrating AI systems into their operations.

With these details in mind, let’s take a look at the top 15 stocks in Glen Kacher’s Light Street Capital portfolio.

Our Methodology

“Indie Semiconductor, Inc. is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of automotive semiconductors for advanced driver assistance systems and connected-car user experience and electrification applications. Shares fell during the quarter due to investor concerns that near-term automotive semiconductor demand will face headwinds because of excess inventory in the automotive semiconductor supply chain, combined with third quarter revenue guidance that slightly missed consensus expectations due to a customer slightly delaying the launch of a new vehicle model where indie had secured a design win (so delayed, not lost sales). As indie steadily ramps new product and design wins into production, we are confident the company will achieve its targeted model of profitability by year end, while effectively doubling revenues as it delivers on its $4.3 billion and growing strategic backlog. We believe indie has the potential to grow from its $200 million revenue run rate today to its targeted $500 million by 2025 and $1 billion by 2028. In the years ahead, indie should benefit as it develops differentiated, highly integrated, energy-efficient products, while the automotive semiconductor vertical remains highly attractive over the long term.”

Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”

“Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)– Cellebrite provides tools to law enforcement to extract data (evidence) from cell phones, analyze the data, and manage the data. Solving many crimes without their tools is inconceivable. They are mission critical. One of the best indicators of business quality is pricing power. The ability to raise price only comes with attributes such as high switching costs and a limited competitive landscape. Cellebrite benefits from both, but has not aggressively flexed their pricing power to date. After being acquired by private equity, the company’s competitor, Grayshift, has reportedly been raising prices by more than 30% on select products. Cellebrite is taking more of a velvet glove approach, offering newer products with more functionality at higher prices, e.g., their “Premium” offering, which offers additional features and is, in fact, “premium” but is also 40-50% more expensive. The combination of raising prices, introducing new products, and cross-selling analytics products should fuel growth for the next several years. Extracting data from devices and making sense of it is not going to get easier nor is it going to become less mission-critical. Law enforcement needs tools to fight crime, and Cellebrite is the leading “arms dealer” to collect and review data from mobile phones.

Light Street Capital’s Equity Stake: $15.79 Million

Tsai Capital Corporation, an investment management firm, mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:

“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 – up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla’s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.”

(NASDAQ:GOOG) (8.52% weight in the Fund): Google’s earnings report in October showed its core advertising business accelerating to double digit growth as the digital advertising recession of 2022 and early 2023 fades away. However, the company’s Cloud division, which is expected to generate growth from selling access to artificial intelligence services, saw its growth rate slow modestly. Juxtaposed with Microsoft’s Cloud business seeing growth pick up slightly, investors sold off Google’s stock on the report. While the stock recovered to new highs by the end of the year, the earnings report set back caused the stock to trail behind the S&P 500 with a gain of 6.8% for the quarter.”

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at theHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.

Charles Paquelet is an American hedge fund manager who founded Skylands Capital in 2004. Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:

''Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,"" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.

In 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital. The fund had $661 million under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. You will see some of the top names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the fund's portfolio as well as spot under-the-radar small-cap names which could explode in the future.

Charles Paquelet's Investment Philosophy

Skylands Capital's investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to ""extrapolate"" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who ""can anticipate change before it is obvious.""

Value or Growth?

Charles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.

""It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important,"" the fund's website says.

Methodology

For this article we scanned Skylands Capital's Q3'2023 portfolio and picked its top ten technology stock picks. Why do we pay attention to what hedge funds are doing? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

10. Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,318,380

Skylands Capital bought a new stake in entertainment and games company Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund's stake in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was valued at $1.3 million as of the end of September 2023.

In December, Jefferies said it believes the gaming industry will see a slowdown in 2024 as gamers become more selective and prudent with their purchases. Jefferies said at the time that even though Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) was expected to post 2025 guidance below expectations, its upcoming games like Battlefield, Sims, Skate and new Star Wars titles will ""re-accelerate topline and drive margin expansion.""

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA).

9. Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $1,406,860

Industrial technology company Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) ranks ninth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital owns a $1.41 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). Over the past one year the stock has gained about 50% in value.

Insider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 23 hedge funds had stakes in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT). The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT) during this period was Chuck Royce's Royce & Associates which owns a $49 million stake in Vontier Corp (NYSE:VNT).

Like Vontier, hedge funds are also investing in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V).

8. Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,433,715

Satellite technology company Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) ranks eighth in our list of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet's top tech stock picks. Skylands Capital, as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, owns a $2.4 million stake in Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM). Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a new stock pick of the hedge fund.

In November, Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) CEO Matthew J Desch bought 28,000 shares of Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) at $37.01 per share.

Baron Growth Fund made the following comment about Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a leading mobile voice and data communications services vendor offering global coverage via satellite. Shares fell on second quarter earnings, growth modestly slower than expected. Investors were also concerned by a potential slowdown in Iridium’s voice and data segment following several years during which the segment benefited from price increases and competition displacements. We attribute the earnings miss to a one-time write off of a spare satellite. This will not impact the company’s long-term prospects. We also remain excited about the potential benefit from Iridium’s recent partnership with Qualcomm to allow satellite connectivity on its new Snapdragon chips. While Iridium has suggested the realization of the direct-to-device opportunity might take longer than some investors had hoped, we believe the collaboration will yield substantial revenue for the company over time. We also remain excited about the company’s capital allocation program, which should benefit shareholders in the years ahead.”

7. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,612,316

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top tech stock picks of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet since his hedge fund Skylands Capital has a $2.6 million stake in the ecommerce retailer which is also a part of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that have gained a lot amid the AI boom.

UBS recently published a list of quality stocks it believes could outperform in 2024. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was part of the list. UBS said in its note that these Buy-rated stocks are in ""30% top for quality, have positive earnings momentum, are not crowded -- have a crowding data score better than 0.1 -- and have reasonable value without overly high beta.""

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the most popular technology stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 286 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“For the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon’s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company’s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.”

6. SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC)

Skylands Capital's Stake Value: $4,148,033

SaaS company SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) ranks sixth in our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Charles Paquelet. Skylands Capital had a $4.1 million stake in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC). The biggest stakeholder of SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SSNC) during this period was Richard S.

Diamond Hill Long-Short Fund made the following comment about SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Our bottom contributors in Q3 were all from our long book, including HCA Healthcare and SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC). SS&C Technologies, a provider of software and services to investment firms, brokerages and other financial institutions, has faced slower organic growth in recent quarters as its business units have produced inconsistent results. Further, rising costs have crimped margins — issues we believe will eventually stabilize but which we are monitoring closely. However, we believe the market is overly pessimistic about the company’s ability to improve its organic growth rate and its margins and are maintaining our position.”

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"On the flip side, other stocks such as small cap stocks often do well when the economy is growing since it provides them with the potential to expand operations and increase sales. Balancing a portfolio often requires subjective judgment, and in today's highly connected and fast paced world, a keen monitoring of local and global events to see whether markets as a whole will remain stable or not.

Today, we'll take a look at some of the most profitable blue chip stocks right now. Profit is an important indicator of a stock's financial health since it measures the money that is available for growth reinvesting, retained capital, or dividends if the company is a dividend paying stock. It also shows that financial managers have managed to manage debt and expenses to ensure investor payouts, and provides an analyst comfort that a firm should be able to handle any economic or market headwinds.

Some of the most profitable blue chip stocks on our list are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A). For more blue chip stocks, you can also check out 10 Top Rated Blue Chip Stocks Wall Street Analysts Are In Love With: January 2024.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company’s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.

The Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what’s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.

Looking Beyond Encouraging Demand Trends

The Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.

According to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled – a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.

There is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.

Apple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.

The AR/VR Market Has Room for Disruption

Empirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple’s success stems from the company’s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.

Today, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.

The relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.

Apple’s Scale Problem

Apple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.

The problem with Apple’s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.

Even if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple’s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.

The highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company’s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.

Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?

Apple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple’s prospects, but they’re currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here’s what some analysts have said about Apple.

On January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock’s price target from $208 to $225, citing the company’s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.

On January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank’s best investment ideas.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.

Last week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.

Overall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.

The Takeaway: Vision Pro is Exciting, Apple’s Valuation Is Not

Apple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple’s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Amazon.Com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced a significant expansion in Mississippi with a $10 billion investment by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to build two data center complexes, the most essential capital investment in the state’s history.

In collaboration with the Madison County Economic Development Authority, this project aims to create at least 1,000 new jobs and boost Mississippi’s tech sector and GDP.

Roger Wehner, AWS’s economic development director, highlighted the investment’s potential to generate well-paying jobs and new regional opportunities.

Recently, Amazon named John Felton as the new AWS CFO, succeeding Richard Puccio, to supervise Amazon’s cloud unit.

Amazon’s commitment to Mississippi extends beyond this project, with investments totaling $2.3 billion since 2010.

These include infrastructure projects, renewable energy initiatives like the state’s first utility-scale wind farm in Tunica County, and a Whole Foods Market location.

The wind farm alone will likely create nearly 300 jobs during peak construction and provide significant tax revenue.

Overall, Amazon’s presence in Mississippi has created 7,500 direct jobs and supports an additional 9,000 indirect jobs while aiding over 1,000 independent sellers in the state.

The company’s efforts focus on helping local jobs, economic growth, and education and enabling opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses.

Earlier this month, AWS shared plans to invest close to 2.3 trillion yen ($15.5 billion) in Japan between 2023 and 2027 to foster data centers and bolster business operations.

The investment in Japan will exceed the ₹1.056 trillion ($12.7 billion) AWS earmarked for India.

In the second quarter of 2023, Amazon held a dominant share of 32% compared to Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Azure’s 22%, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud’s 11%.

Price Action: AMZN shares are up 0.54% at $158.60 premarket on the last check Friday.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is implementing layoffs of close to 700 employees, about 1% of its 70,000-strong workforce, following a previous reduction of 10% or around 8,000 workers in 2023.

This move comes amid ongoing cost-cutting pressures from investors, including activist shareholders like Elliott Management, to drive its margins.

Despite these cuts, Salesforce still maintains 1,000 open positions, suggesting these layoffs are part of workforce adjustments rather than a significant strategic shift, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The company’s focus is on directing spending towards growth.

Last September, Salesforce also shared plans to hire nearly 3,300 new employees across various departments, focusing significantly on sales, engineering, and developing the company’s data cloud product.

These steps have contributed to a significant boost in its stock value, which increased by almost 80% over the last 12 months, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Index’s 37% rise.

Tech firms increasingly focus on artificial intelligence (AI), leading to a hiring surge in this area while other sectors face layoffs into 2024. Over 20,000 tech workers have been laid off so far in 2024, as reported by layoffs.

In January 2023, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google divulged plans to eliminate 12,000 positions, comprising 6% of its global employees.

According to Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, while companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google heavily invest in AI, they are cutting back in non-strategic areas, CNBC reports.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has informed employees of more impending job cuts as the company shifts its investments towards AI.

Alex Kantrowitz of Big Technology notes that in the current economic climate, Big Tech companies need to find cost-cutting measures to invest in the expensive AI sector, a trend other major tech firms are likely to follow.

In 2023, the tech sector let go of 141,516 employees in the first half of the year compared with about 6,000 a year ago.

German software company SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) announced the restructuring of about 8,000 roles to focus more on AI.",0.0184540719696969,0.4509232954545454,Neutral,0.99241441488266,0.4523933677690329
GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Google parent Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is up on Thursday. It resolved a patent lawsuit on Wednesday involving AI technology, with the claim amounting to an extraordinary $1.67 billion.

Singular Computing, established by Massachusetts computer scientist Joseph Bates, initiated the lawsuit. The company accused Google of misusing its computer-processing solutions.

Google has also partnered with Hugging Face, a startup specializing in AI software, to host its platform on Google’s cloud computing network.

This collaboration will allow Hugging Face to offer its platform through Google Cloud, significantly expanding developers’ access to the startup’s AI tools.

The Hugging Face partnership will likely accelerate innovation by enabling more developers to create AI applications using Hugging Face’s resources and Google Cloud’s computing capabilities and specialized hardware, Bloomberg reports.

This agreement bolsters Google’s relationship with the open-source AI community, a sector increasingly competitive with significant tech companies in developing cost-effective AI models.

Hugging Face, a New York-based company founded in 2016, has gained popularity for sharing open-source AI models.

Through this partnership, developers using Hugging Face will benefit from the technological resources of Google Cloud.

Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue highlighted the partnership’s potential to enhance the capabilities of both Hugging Face users and Google Cloud customers.

Google’s involvement in Hugging Face’s recent funding round, valued at $4.5 billion, further solidifies its collaborative efforts in the AI field.

In 2023, Google committed close to $2 billion to AI startup Anthropic after reports of Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) decided to earmark $4 billion.

Google already integrated its Bard artificial intelligence chatbot with several popular products, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs.

Big tech companies, including Amazon, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google, remain aggressively invested in their AI ambitions. Analysts projected $1 trillion in AI-driven opportunities for companies like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) as they wholeheartedly splurge on AI technology.

Price Action: GOOG shares are trading higher by 1.66% at $152.85 on the last check Thursday.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"The Magnificent Seven tech stocks, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), are again driving the stock market’s surge.

These tech giants, known for their stellar performance last year, have returned 4.4% this month, outperforming the S&P 500.

Investors are flocking to tech stocks, with approximately $4 billion poured into tech funds in the past two weeks, marking the most significant inflow since August, the Wall Street Journal reports.

In 2023, these seven stocks collectively doubled in value, adding a staggering $5.1 trillion to their market capitalization.

Among these tech giants, Nvidia is a critical player in the ongoing tech-driven rally.

The company’s success is closely linked to the surging demand for semiconductor chips, especially those used to power artificial intelligence (AI) programs.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), a significant supplier for semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, recently announced its expected 20% revenue growth for the year.

Analysts remained bullish on Nvidia, citing improving PCs, AI deep learning, and inferencing markets now with generative AI tailwinds, gaming trends, automotive, and data centers.

The Big Tech stocks remain invested in ramping up their AI capabilities. Analysts have voiced $1 trillion in AI-driven opportunity for Nvidia being the frontrunner in GPU and chip supply.

This growing demand is a critical factor in the resurgence of these tech stocks and the broader stock market.

While the Magnificent Seven tech stocks have been performing well, it’s important to note that their returns this year, although impressive, have not reached the levels seen in the previous January.

Despite the slightly more modest outlook, Wall Street analysts recommend these stocks, projecting an average return of 8.6% for the group over the next 12 months.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is under fire from employees past and present who think that the company's leadership lacks vision.

What Happened: Diane Hirsh Theriault, a software engineer at Google, criticized the tech giant’s leadership on LinkedIn earlier last week. Theriault asserted that the company lacks visionary leaders and has been conducting random layoffs for the past six to 12 months.

Theriault described Google’s leaders as “profoundly boring and glassy-eyed,” stating that the company hasn’t launched a successful executive-driven initiative in years.

The employee also criticized Google’s approach to product development, comparing it to the BogoSort algorithm, where elements are reordered randomly until they land in order.

According to the post, Google’s executives are trying to steer the company towards artificial intelligence (AI), but without a clear vision.

Meanwhile, layoffs continue across various departments, including engineering, sales, support, UX, product, data science, and SRE.

See Also: Ex-Googler Calls Out CEO Sundar Pichai’s ‘Lack Of Visionary Leadership,’ Says Company Morale At ‘An All-Time Low’

The employee also highlighted a growing sense of nihilism among the staff, with many choosing to just do their jobs until they are let go. The post ended with a lament for the loss of Google’s once magical work environment and the fear-driven atmosphere that has replaced it.

According to Equity Research Analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Justin Patterson, Google CEO Sundar Pichai's quest for ""durable cost savings"" might have harmed the company.

""While we expect layoffs will be more modest than 2022’s, we do believe Alphabet may have unintentionally harmed productivity by creating uncertainty over which roles will be affected,"" Patterson noted.

Why It Matters: This isn’t the first time Google’s leadership has been called into question. In November, former Google employee Ian “Hixie” Hickinson criticized Pichai for displaying a ""lack of visionary leadership"" and disinterest in maintaining the ethos of Google that made it a successful company.

He also stated that the employee morale at Google is at an all-time low and that therapists in the Bay Area would say that all Googlers are “unhappy” with the company.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Insider Ownership Of Oscar Health

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

We can report that insiders do own shares in Oscar Health, Inc.. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own US$66m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.

General Public Ownership

With a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Oscar Health. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 22%, private equity firms could influence the Oscar Health board. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.

Public Company Ownership

Public companies currently own 6.2% of Oscar Health stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Oscar Health , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. You can also check out the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Under $10 here.

Cloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.

The growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.

Currently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.

Even with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.

The Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) is significantly expanding its operations in response to growing demand in the AI, 5G, server, and data center markets.

The company remains engaged in its geographical expansion while maintaining Taiwan as its base.

Acter Group Co, a semiconductor equipment and chemicals supplier, is accelerating its overseas expansion, primarily focusing on Japan and Southeast Asia to support these demands.

The expansion is a strategic response to geopolitical risks and the need for diversified manufacturing sites, Taipei Times reports.

Acter Group Co-President Wang Chun-sheng emphasized the company’s strategy to enhance its global footprint.

Acter’s significant clients include TSMC, United Microelectronics Co (NYSE:UMC), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia Corp, and Alphabet Inc’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

In addition to Asia, Acter is considering expansion projects in Mexico and the US, aiming to follow their clients’ geographical diversification.

Acter prioritizes Southeast Asia, Japan, and India for overseas expansion.

Last month, Acter’s subsidiary, Rayzher Industrial Co, established a branch in Kumamoto, Japan, to support TSMC’s fab operations.

Rayzher is also planning a second overseas site in Germany, where TSMC will likely build a new 12-inch fab through a joint venture.

TSMC Stock Prediction For 2024

Equity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.

Some investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Taiwan Semiconductor, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Taiwan Semiconductor, the 200-day moving average sits at $120.13, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $170.84.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"We recently published a list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.

UBS Global Wealth Management’s (GWM) recently published a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI “value chain,” estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.

UBS segments the AI market into three layers – Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem — infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments, Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.

Next up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.

The third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it’s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers — think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.

Key AI Predictions

The UBS report also made key “predictions” about the AI landscape. The firm’s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a “capex cycle” that could “inflate” the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects “monolithic players” and “AI foundries” prevailing in the near future.

Based on this report, let’s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 165

According to the latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain – enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.

Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”

Overall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Wealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.

FAANG: Stocks With Real Bite

When people talk about the FAANG stocks, they’re referring to five of the most prominent and traditionally high-performing tech and social media companies. Here’s what the acronym originally stood for, though now it’s a little outdated.

Facebook, now called Meta Platforms, with the ticker symbol META.

Apple, with the ticker symbol AAPL, which hasn’t changed since the company’s December 12, 1980, initial public offering.

Amazon, another globally recognized brand, with the ticker symbol AMZN.

Netflix, which still sports its original ticker symbol, NFLX.

Google, whose parent company is now Alphabet Inc., though it’s retained the ticker symbol GOOG.

Together, the FAANG stocks are often referenced for their consistently strong market performance, ongoing efforts to innovate and huge market capitalizations.

A Decade of Technological Development

In terms of how far and fast technology has developed, 2014 seems like a lot more than 10 years ago. The tech sector was still seen as one of the largest opportunities for growth and formed the backbone of many forward-thinking financial strategies. But even the most astute analysts would have been hard-pressed to predict how big these tech companies would become and the financial performance that has made them the titans they are today.

Historical FAANG Prices Compared With Where They Are Today

Here are the prices of each of the five FAANG stocks from 10 years ago and today.

If you had invested $5,000 equally in these five companies, for an investment of $1,000 each, those $1,000 investments would look something like the following.",0.1902131782945736,0.4167958656330749,Neutral,0.9998786449432372,0.4417033744022204
GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified briefly Friday at the federal financial conspiracy trial surrounding buzz-to-bust startup Ozy Media, countering founder Carlos Watson's alleged claims that the search giant once sought to buy Ozy.

Google did consider hiring Watson for a high-level news executive job in 2021 and putting $25 million into Ozy in something of a tradeoff for luring him away, Pichai told jurors.

“Mr. Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,"" he explained.

But “did you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?” prosecutor Dylan Stern asked.

“No,” replied Pichai, who heads Google and parent Alphabet Inc.

He said he had been introduced to Watson at a conference and then in a video interview for a possible Google job interacting with news outlets. Neither the hire nor the $25 million investment ultimately happened.

According to prosecutors, Watson later told another prospective investor that Pichai himself had extended a nine-figure offer to buy Ozy. The Mountain View, California-based company produced TV programs, podcasts and a music-and-ideas festival before falling apart in fall 2021 amid questions about whether it had flagrantly misrepresented its audience reach, deals and finances.

Ozy Media lawyer Shannon Frison said in an emailed statement Friday that it's “unequivocally untrue"" that Watson told anyone that Google had made a $600 million offer.

“He never had such a conversation with Google and never told any person that he did,” Frison said.

Watson and Ozy Media have pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit fraud. He has said that he built a robust and real company, didn't con anyone and is being singled out for prosecution when he made, at most, entrepreneurial “mistakes.”

Defense lawyers have blamed any misrepresentations on Ozy co-founder Samir Rao, saying he is falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison himself. Rao pleaded guilty to identity theft and conspiring to commit fraud, and he is awaiting sentencing.

He testified earlier in the trial that his “moral compass” got scrambled by ambition, desperation to keep the company going and “Carlos’ deep belief that failure was not an option and we had to do whatever it took.”

Among other deceit, Rao infamously posed as a YouTube executive — even using a phone app to disguise his voice — in order to champion Ozy to Goldman Sachs investment bankers on a February 2021 call.

“It was one of the most disturbing calls that I have ever been on in my career,” Goldman executive Hillel Moerman testified Friday, calling the episode “a surreal experience.”",-0.0322463768115942,0.5764492753623189,Neutral,0.9977400302886964,0.4661490249235622

The previously proprietary platform will now be available under an Apache 2.0 license, allowing other companies to utilize and modify the underlying architecture and code without incurring costs.

The Unity Catalog will also include an OpenAPI specification, server, and clients, allowing enterprises to access and manage their data and AI assets without vendor lock-in.

This significant move by Databricks enables organizations to use the Unity Catalog with their preferred tools, including a vast ecosystem of Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg-compatible query engines, VentureBeat reports.

This comes shortly after Databricks’ competitor, Snowflake Inc (NYSE:SNOW), introduced its open catalog implementation, Polaris Catalog, which will be open-sourced over the next 90 days. Snowflake stock is trading lower on Thursday.

The Unity Catalog’s open APIs ensure compatibility with major cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP, and Salesforce and compute engines such as Apache Spark, Presto, Trino, and others.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 8th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Billionaire Israel Englander is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund’s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg’s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium’s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander’s imposition of “tight guardrails” to limit losses. To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.

The report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is “not a good idea.”

The FT report said Englander’s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022, 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.

For this article, we scanned Millennium Management’s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund’s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is apparently in a no-holds-barred fight against competitors in the AI race that according to many threatened the bread and butter of Google its search business. However, many analysts believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is making a big turn and will continue to grow. Alex Kantrowitz, Big Technology founder, while talking to CNBC last month, said that the present for Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"On Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) posted its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were below estimates.

Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype.

The aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to extend Azure Al to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl. Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google’s cloud infrastructure. As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges. Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle’s cloud database growth.

Outlook Shaped By The AI Hype

For the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%.

Oracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024.

For the current fiscal year ending in May 2025, Catz expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads, adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand.

Shifting focus away from weak Q4 financials.

Meanwhile, Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st. Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won’t last forever.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) shares were trading higher in the premarket in a volatile Monday session, indicating a possible rebound.

Last Friday, the stock closed lower by 39% after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings ahead of its schedule and Roaring Kitty held a live stream.

While many were looking for an updated thesis on why Gill is investing heavily in GameStop once again, several investors were left with more questions after the stream.

The livestream ended up being disappointing for investors and the stock.

The video game retailer reported net sales of $881.8 million, down from $1.237 billion last year, lagging the analyst consensus estimate of $995.3 million.

GameStop reported an EPS loss of $(0.12), missing the analyst consensus estimate loss of $(0.09).

The quarterly net loss improved to $(32.3) million, down from $(50.5) million last year. GameStop also disclosed an at-the-market offering program, which permitted the sale of up to 75 million shares.

This added to the 45 million shares sold last month, which raised $933 million.

Last week, Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty, expressed his backing for CEO Ryan Cohen during an Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube livestream, the Financial Times reports.

The retailer’s core business has been declining, with store numbers shrinking by over a quarter in five years, but investment gains have mitigated some losses.

Gill confirmed his significant investment in GameStop and denied working with any third-party funder.

Investors can gain exposure to the GameStop stock via iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJH) and SPDR MidCap Trust Series I (NYSE:MDY).

Price Action: GME shares traded lower by 3.05% at $27.36 at the last check Monday.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Latest data analyzed by Bank of America shows that across all devices, Google's market search in search actually gained half a percentage point in May on a MoM basis. BofA analyst Justin Post said this shows Alphabet Inc Class C's (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Overviews are ""aiding query growth and usage.""

Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrated with other Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) apps. Alphabet Inc Class C's (NASDAQ:GOOG) goal is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc Class C's (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.

Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc Class C's (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet's 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the next five years on a per annum basis.

Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:

“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"By Ira Dugal and Aftab Ahmed

DHOLERA, India /NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans a raft of business-friendly measures if he wins a third term this week, including pushing through regulations making it easier to hire and fire workers, according to two government officials familiar with the matter.

As part of an election pledge to transform India into a global manufacturing hub, Modi wants to offer subsidies for domestic production modelled on recent packages for semiconductor firms and electric vehicle makers, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to media.

The premier also plans to reduce import taxes on key inputs for locally-made goods, which have pushed up India's manufacturing costs, the officials said.

Modi's office and the labour and finance ministries did not respond to Reuters' questions.

Exit polls project that the right-wing coalition led by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will win a big majority when election results are announced on June 4.

Modi's reelection campaign was partly built on the promise of continued economic development. He's pitching India as an alternative for global firms diversifying their supply chains from China.

India is the world's fastest-growing major economy. But that includes both a booming tech sector and a struggling older economy that doesn't provide enough jobs for everyone else, said Josh Felman, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's office in India.

""What can be done now to provide employment - good jobs for these people - is manufacturing,"" Felman said.

India successfully lured suppliers for major U.S. corporations like Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. But less than 3% of global manufacturing takes place in the world's most populous country, compared to 24% for China, World Bank data shows.

The government plans to increase India's share of global manufacturing to 5% by 2030 and 10% by 2047, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. It did not provide specifics.

Reuters spoke to 15 people - including bureaucrats, representatives of major investors, economists and trade unionists - who identified three significant obstacles holding India back from manufacturing hub status: restrictive labour laws, challenges acquiring land, and a rigidly inefficient tariff regime.

INDIA'S PEARL RIVER DELTA?

When Modi was chief minister of his home state of Gujarat between 2001 and 2014, he dreamt up an investment zone in the Dholera region. Legislation creating the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR) was passed in 2009 and local authorities began acquiring land for it in 2013.

The plan, Modi said during a 2011 visit to a Chinese port, was to develop DSIR along the ""Shanghai model"".

Starting in the 1980s, China set up special economic zones along its southeastern coast that are widely credited for it becoming the world's factory floor.

Land reform was a precursor for China's manufacturing rise. Starting in the 1970s, Beijing separated ownership from usage rights, making it easier for investors to acquire industrial land, said Henry Gao, a Chinese trade expert at Singapore Management University (SMU).

Beijing's industrial zoning policies also made it easier for industries to set up in areas with ready access to materials and facilities, he said.

As prime minister, Modi has continued to stress the importance of industrial zones for India. In March, he described facilities under construction in DSIR as central to the creation of an Indian semi-conductor manufacturing hub.

Tata Group announced plans in January to build India's first semi-conductor fabrication plant there. During a visit in March, Reuters also saw construction activity for an upcoming cargo airport and promotional billboards set up by real-estate developers.

There were paved roads and a waterfront but little sign of bustling business.

DSIR hopes to attract more manufacturing companies by providing leases of up to 99 years on government-owned land, said Rahul Gupta, head of the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation.

Local officials have said that it took more than a decade to acquire land and award infrastructure contracts, but Gupta predicted there would be much more activity in about two to three years.

Outside such zones, industrial groups still have to undergo a ""very difficult process"" to acquire the large plots of land they need because title deeds are often unclear and holdings are fractured, said Richard Rossow of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.

In May, Foxconn - whose local investment was trumpeted as a major success by Modi - was met with protests by farmers in Karnataka state unhappy with the compensation they received from local authorities for giving up their land to the manufacturer, Indian media reported.

The Taiwanese company didn't return a request for comment.

LABOUR STRUGGLES

In much of India, firms with more than 100 employees need authorisation from state governments to hire and fire.

This prevents companies from adjusting their operations to meet demand, said Atul Gupta, partner at Bengalore law firm Trilegal.

The BJP-controlled parliament has passed legislation to raise the threshold before official approval to 300, but state authorities that must consent to the changes have stalled the move.

Modi hopes that a strong win on June 4th will give him the momentum and political capital to push through their opposition, the two government officials said.

""No government wants to come across as giving permission to a company to let go of their employees (but)...this is just used to drag out the closure or the terminations endlessly,"" said Gupta, who advocates labour reforms.

General Motors, for instance, decided to shut plants in Gujarat and neighboring Maharastra in 2017, citing low sales. But unions opposed the closures and GM only received judicial approval to exit India completely in January. The U.S. carmaker declined to comment.

To avoid such difficulties, companies end up using contract workers for extended periods, said labour lawyer Amrish Patel.

HSBC economists said that sweeping changes to labour regulations as well as land reforms are needed to sustain high growth.

In a note to investors last month, HSBC economist Pranjul Bhandari wrote that such reforms could allow India to grow at 7.5-8% over the next decade, creating a wealth of jobs.

But lawyer and union leader Sanjay Singhvi said nearly 60% of the workers who benefit from current labour laws would lose protections if the BJP's codes are implemented.

Praveen Chakravarty, a senior economics policy official with the main opposition Congress, told Reuters that labour law decisions should be left to the states. His party's manifesto calls for a review of the labour codes passed by parliament.

TARIFF LAND

Manufacturing costs in India are also elevated because of tariffs on imports, including components for high-end manufacturing.

To encourage smartphone production, Delhi cut import duties on components to 10%. But competitor Vietnam already levies a rate of between 0% and 5% on equivalent inputs, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association.

The average import tariff imposed by India on World Trade Organisation (WTO) members was 18.1%, compared to 7.5% for China, according to WTO data for 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available.

Customs processes are also significantly quicker and less burdensome in China, said Gao.

Imports can clear customs in China in about 20 hours, said the SMU professor. It takes between 44 and 85 hours in India, according to a 2023 government study.

Beijing has focused its efforts on being a key node in the supply chain rather than attempting to own the entire chain, leading to greater efficiencies.

For instance, products exported by China often include inputs from other Northeast Asian countries, said Christian de Guzman of Moody’s Ratings.

But Delhi ""wants to have the entire thing come onshore,"" Guzman said.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is concerned about some of OpenAI’s business dealings, particularly a potential agreement between OpenAI and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Satya Nadella recently met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to discuss this deal involving integrating OpenAI services into Apple products.

Nadella’s concerns stem from the potential impact on Microsoft’s product ambitions, the Business Insider reports.

Apple’s deal with OpenAI will solidify Altman’s control over the company after his brief ouster last fall.

Altman, who has pushed out rivals from the board, aims to replace Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google as Apple’s search partner for Safari and build AI chip factories.

However, Microsoft, a significant investor in OpenAI, is concerned about the impact of the Apple deal on its own AI ambitions, according to the New York Post.

Apple considered both Google and OpenAI for this multi-billion-dollar deal.

If confirmed, this agreement would be a significant win for Altman, who has faced scrutiny from former employees and board members.

Tensions within OpenAI have reportedly been brewing since Altman’s brief ouster in November. An insider revealed to The Financial Times that Microsoft pressured OpenAI to prioritize commercial products, exacerbating existing tensions between executives.

Despite these challenges, OpenAI’s valuation has soared to $90 billion since launching ChatGPT.

Altman is considering converting OpenAI into a for-profit corporation to attract significant capital and expand its AI infrastructure.

OpenAI’s annual revenue crossed the $2 billion mark. The ChatGPT parent eyes doubling revenue by 2025.

Microsoft stock gained over 26% in the last 12 months. Apple gained 8%.

Price Actions: MSFT shares traded higher by 0.06% at $414.93 premarket at the last check Friday. AAPL is down 0.14% at $191.03.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Google plans to invest $2 billion in Malaysia, developing its first data center and a Google Cloud hub in the latest big foray by a U.S. tech giant in the Southeast Asian country.

The news follows Microsoft's recent announcement that it would put $2.2 billion over the next four years into building Malaysia’s new cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hailed Google’s investment as a sign of faith in Malaysia’s governance and economy. Anwar said Thursday that the investment is expected to add $3.2 billion to the economy and create 26,500 jobs by 2030.

The investments are a coup for Anwar as he seeks to consolidate his strength against a strong Islamic opposition.

Google said in a statement that the new hubs will be developed at a business park in central Malaysia's Selangor state, to meet growing demand for cloud services and for artificial intelligence literacy programs for Malaysian students and educators.

Malaysia will be the 12th country to house a Google data center. The Malaysian Google Cloud hub — which will deliver services to large enterprises, startups and the public sector, will join 40 regions and 121 zones currently in operation around the world, it said.

“This investment builds on our partnership with the government of Malaysia to advance its ‘Cloud First Policy,’ including best-in-class cybersecurity standards,” said Ruth Porat, Alphabet Inc.'s president and chief financial officer.

Over the past five years, their shares have lost 89%, 24%, and 89%, respectively. Mind you though, this doesn't mean that quantum computing stocks never go up. For instance, take the example of IonQ. The firm listed its shares for trading in October after a merger, and between October 8th and November 19th, the stock soared by a whopping 233%. For comparison, Wall Street's AI darling NVIDIA's shares have gained 239% over the past twelve months.

So, the next question to ask is, what happened to this quantum computing stock? Well, part of the reason is a Goldman Sachs investment note that was released in November 2022. The note wondered when businesses would start adopting quantum computing into their operations, and whether the company's technology roadmap could align with this shift, as uncertainty persisted over ""which forms of quantum computer ultimately captures market share,"" according to analyst Toshiya Hari. After losing 14% in the wake of Hari's comments, the stock would proceed to bottom out over the new year in January, but its performance graph changes when we zoom into 2024's performance. April 2024 seems to have been the month for IonQ's shares as the stock is up by 17% since the 19th.

Click to see 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.

Billionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management recently made headlines when his latest portfolio showed the 66-year-old owner of Carolina Panthers was piling into Chinese stocks while clearly cutting his exposure to mega-cap tech stocks which have already rewarded him heftily over the past several quarters, thanks to the AI-led rally. Tepper's bet on Chinese stocks comes at a time when many analysts are predicting a rebound of Chinese economy as the government begins to devise more rescue plans for the devastated property sector. The MSCI China index is up about 10% since the end of March.

David Tepper, who founded Appaloosa Management back in 1993, returned 20% last year, thanks to his huge stake in AI stocks. A cursory analysis of David Tepper, worth over $20 billion, shows that he was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper's instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he'd joined in 1985.

Tepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the mist of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:

“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”

Billionaire David Tepper Q1'2024 Stake Value: $315,939,500

David Tepper first bought a stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the third quarter of 2024, gradually adding to his position over the years. However, the billionaire started decreasing his hold in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) significantly in 2021. In the first quarter, Appaloosa decreased its position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) by 10%. The fund still owns a $316 million stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).",0.1705092592592592,0.4100462962962963,Neutral,0.5290287137031555,0.502968643382583

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit announced a partnership with AI startup Hugging Face to simplify running thousands of AI models on Amazon’s custom computing chips.

On Wednesday, Amazon and Hugging Face announced a collaboration to enable this on Amazon Web Services (AWS) custom chip called Inferentia2, Reuters reports.

Valued at $4.5 billion, Hugging Face has become a key platform for AI researchers and developers to share chatbots and other AI software.

Amazon, Google’s Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) back Hugging Face, among others.

It is the primary destination for developers exploring open-source AI models such as Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 3.

“Efficiency is crucial to us – ensuring that as many people as possible can run models cost-effectively,” said Jeff Boudier, head of product and growth at Hugging Face.

AWS aims to attract more AI developers to use its cloud services for AI delivery. While Nvidia leads in training models, AWS claims its chips can operate those trained models – an inference process – at a lower cost over time.

Recent reports indicated that Matt Garman will take over as AWS CEO, succeeding Adam Selipsky, effective June 3.

During its latest quarterly results, Amazon announced that AWS became a $100-billion annual revenue run rate business.

AWS led the global cloud service market in the fourth quarter, accounting for 31% of total cloud spending.

Amazon analysts had highlighted the upside of AI chip development and diverse large language model offerings.

Amazon stock gained 59% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR Select Sector Fund – Consumer Discretionary (NYSE:XLY) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (NYSE:FDIS).

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"ChatGPT parent OpenAI has disbanded a team dedicated to ensuring the safety of potentially ultra-capable AI systems after the group’s leaders, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever, departed.

The so-called superalignment team, established less than a year ago under Sutskever and Jan Leike, has been absorbed into broader research efforts across the company, Bloomberg reports.

This integration aims to maintain the focus on safety while addressing the recent high-profile exits that have stirred debates over the company’s speed versus safety in AI development.

Leike resigned following Sutskever’s departure, citing challenges such as insufficient resources and increasing difficulties in conducting crucial research.

Other team members, Leopold Aschenbrenner and Pavel Izmailov, have also left OpenAI.

John Schulman will lead OpenAI’s alignment work, and Jakub Pachocki, who will take over Sutskever’s role, has been appointed the new chief scientist.

In April, the United States and the United Kingdom agreed to address the concerns about AI safety.

The Biden Administration has actively engaged tech companies and banking firms to address AI dangers. AI giants like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) joined the White House’s AI safety initiative in February.

In 2023, the AI safety forum, the Frontier Model Forum, spearheaded by OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and AI startup Anthropic, appointed its first director and announced plans to establish an advisory board soon to guide its strategy. The forum also announced plans to develop a fund to support research into the technology.

Despite appreciating the capabilities of the high-NA EUV, Zhang highlighted the economic considerations, stating that TSMC’s upcoming A16 node technology, due in late 2026, will continue to use older EUV technology instead of the new high-NA EUV machines.

He noted the rising costs of factory operations as a broader challenge for the industry, with increasing expenses for construction, tools, electricity, and raw materials.

Meanwhile, TSMC is looking to build its $11 billion European chip plant in Dresden, Germany, backed by EU and German support. The plant will produce 22-nm car chips and has plans for advanced tech expansions.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"HONG KONG (AP) — YouTube has blocked access to videos of a protest song in Hong Kong, days after court approved an injunction banning the song in the city.

“Glory to Hong Kong” was an anthem of anti-government protests in 2019. YouTube said that it would comply with a removal order and block access to over 32 YouTube videos of the song that were deemed to be “prohibited publications” under the injunction.

Attempts to access the YouTube videos from Hong Kong on Wednesday showed that they were unavailable. A message showed saying that “This content is not available on this country domain due to a court order.”

In approving the government's application to ban the song, the court agreed it could be “weaponized” and used to incite secession.

“We are disappointed by the court’s decision but are complying with its removal order by blocking access to the listed videos for viewers in Hong Kong,” YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., said in an emailed statement.

“We’ll continue to consider our options for an appeal, to promote access to information,” the company said, adding that it shared the concerns of human rights organizations about the chilling effect the ban would have on free expression online.

Links to the 32 videos on YouTube will also not show up on Google Search for users in Hong Kong, according to YouTube.

George Chen, co-chair of digital practice at Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consultancy, said it is worth watching how aggressively Hong Kong authorities will be in ordering internet platforms to remove the song.

Chen, who was the former head of public policy for Greater China at Meta, said that if the government begins sending platforms hundreds of links to remove every day, that would likely undermine investor confidence in Hong Kong.

“That will hurt Hong Kong’s reputation as a leading financial center because we know how important a free flow of data and information means to a financial center,” he said. “So the government should be very careful and be aware of some unintended consequences that may impact its economic recovery and investors’ confidence.”

Internet and social media platforms such as YouTube typically have policies for removal requests from governments.

“Glory to Hong Kong” was often sung by demonstrators during massive anti-government protests in 2019. The song was later mistakenly played as the city’s anthem at international sporting events, instead of China’s “March of the Volunteers,” in mix-ups that upset city officials.

Authorities earlier arrested some residents who played the song in public under other offenses, such as playing a musical instrument in public without a permit, local media reported.

Critics have said prohibiting broadcast or distribution of the song further reduces freedom of expression since Beijing launched a crackdown in the former British colony following the 2019 protests. They have also warned the ban might disrupt the operation of tech giants and hurt the city’s appeal as a business center.

SYDNEY/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global private equity investors and asset managers are readying for billions of dollars worth of M&A and investments linked to data centres in Asia Pacific, as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom fuels demand for digital infrastructure.

The intense pace of deals in the world's most populous region comes as countries and companies respond to booming demand for AI, calling for more data capacity, industry executives said.

Asia Pacific, including Japan, has led dealmaking activities in the global data centre market this year, with M&A value totalling $840.47 million, more than half of the global amount, LSEG data showed.

In 2023, the region's data centre deals hit a record high of $3.45 billion, according to LSEG. That tally is set to be surpassed this year with at least a couple of large transactions in the pipeline.

A number of financial sponsors, including global investment powerhouse Blackstone Inc, are looking to acquire AirTrunk, which owns 11 hyperscale data centres in Australia and the rest of the region, sources close to the transaction said.

AirTrunk owners, Macquarie Group and Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP), are aiming to value the business at up to A$15 billion ($9.8 billion), sources said, in what could be Asia's largest data centre transaction this year.

AirTrunk, Blackstone, Macquarie and PSP declined to comment.

""The AI revolution is creating an unprecedented wall of demand for high quality data centre capacity,"" said Garren Cronin, managing director of Cadence Advisory, which advised on Australian data centre operator NEXTDC's $861 million capital raising in April.

""The new capacity that needs to be built in Asia Pacific in the next three to five years is simply mind blowing. My expectation is that deal flow in the data centre space will intensify in 2024.""

Microsoft Corp last week said it would invest $2.2 billion over the next four years in Malaysia to expand its cloud and AI services across Asia.

The rise of data centre investments in Asia follows a similar trajectory to that seen in the U.S. and Europe with technology giants including Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc and Meta Platforms rapidly expanding their AI capabilities.

Microsoft will open its first Asian data centre in Thailand, the company said last Wednesday, a day after announcing $1.7 billion worth of investments in AI and cloud facilities in neighbouring Indonesia.

DATA CONSUMPTION

Other potential deals in Asia include Indonesia's state-owned Telkom Indonesia's sale of a stake in its data centre business worth $1 billion and Japan's NEC weighing $500 million data centre sale, according to news reports.

Telkom Senior Vice President Investor Relations Ahmad Reza told Reuters on Wednesday that Telkom is open to strategic partnerships to bring its data centre business arm NeutraDC new capabilities and new markets.

""We have explored several potential partners, but we are still evaluating for the best one,"" he said. ""We expect to finish this process by the end of this year.""

NEC said it was not able to comment on market speculation.

U.S. investment firm Bain Capital is seeking credit financing for the international assets of data centre operator Chindata and investments for its China business, people close to Bain Capital said.

Bain, which took Chindata private from the Hong Kong bourse last year in a $3.16 billion deal, declined to comment.

Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), which invested in AirTrunk in 2017 before selling its stake to a Macquarie-led consortium three years later, has deployed more than $1 billion on data centre development in Asia over the past three years.

The firm would actively invest in additional projects, with a particular focus on Japan and South Korea, said Nikhil Reddy, head of APAC real estate at GSAM.

""AI creates a different type of need for data centres beyond the historic demands of the cloud focused on low latency. Now with AI, which entails massive data consumption, capacity is key,"" he said.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"On May 1, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell categorically denied the resumption of the interest rate hike regime in his post-FOMC meeting statement. Moreover, the FOMC voted to ease the pace at which it is reducing bond holdings on the central bank’s gigantic balance sheet. The Fed started this program in June 2022, which was known as “quantitative tightening.” Its latest decision could be viewed as an incremental loosening of monetary policy.

A Goldilocks Environment?

A Goldilocks scenario is characterized as continuous economic growth but not as much a rapid pace to inflate the aggregate price level to such an extent that the central bank is compelled to tighten monetary policies.

The U.S. economy has cooled but is growing at a pace similar to that of the pre-pandemic level. The labor market shown the signs of crack but not at an alarming pace. The peak inflation rate is far behind us. Finally, there are no signs of any near-term recession. Consequently, this is a golden opportunity to enter U.S. stock markets.

Our Top Picks

We have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital > $100 billion) that have strong growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.

The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL first-quarter results were driven by solid momentum in the cloud business. Further, improving Search performance on the back of major Search updates, was a positive. Also, the strength in YouTube favored the stock. Notably, a robust cloud division remains the key catalyst for GOOGL.

Expanding data centers will continue to bolster GOOGL’s presence in the cloud space. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. GOOGL’s deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.

Zacks Rank #1 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.1% and 30.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.5% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 12.6% from the last closing price of $167.24.

Netflix Inc. NFLX added 9.33 million paid subscribers globally in first-quarter 2024, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.

NFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.

Zacks Rank #1 Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 52.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 13.6% from the last closing price of $579.34.

Amazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, the strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. An expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN in gaining momentum among customers.

AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.

Zacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 56.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.7% over the last seven days. The average price target represents an increase of 16% from the last closing price of $186.21.

ServiceNow Inc. NOW has been benefiting from the rising adoption of its workflows by enterprises undergoing digital transformation. NOW had 1933 total customers with more than $1 million in annual contract value at the end of the first quarter. NOW had eight deals greater than $5 million in net new ACV, and four deals of more than $10 million.

NOW closed 59 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV. The number of customers contributing more than $20 million or more grew 50% year over year. Generative AI deals continued to gain traction with record-breaking net new ACV for Pro Plus, making it the fastest-selling product in NOW’s history.

Zacks Rank #2 ServiceNow has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21.3% and 25.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.9% over the last 30 days. The average price target represents an increase of 19% from the last closing price of $716.65.

Boston Scientific Corp. BSX is seeing strength across target markets despite macroeconomic concerns, currency headwinds and related cost inflation. Strong worldwide demand for BSX’s GI and pulmonary treatment options, traction in Europe for its next generation WATCHMAN FLX, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers.

The Pain and Brain franchisees of BSX are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on the strong execution of core growth strategies. The EP arm received a strong boost on the FDA approval for FARAPULSE.

Zacks Rank #2 Boston Scientific has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12.3% and 13.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 30 days. The average price target represents an increase of 12.2% from the last closing price of $72.85.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, ahead of its annual I/O developer conference in May, has confirmed layoffs across various vital teams such as Flutter, Dart, Python, and others, according to employee reports on social media.

The tech giant did not specify the teams, roles, or the number of individuals affected, TechCrunch reports.

Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert explained that these changes aim to align resources with the company’s most significant product priorities, improve efficiency, and reduce bureaucracy.

The layoffs are part of regular organizational adjustments and are not company-wide. Google encourages those affected to apply for other available positions within the company.

Despite the cuts, Google PM Kevin Moore assured the Flutter development community that they are still focused on upcoming projects, including new updates for Flutter at the I/O conference.

The company has also filed a WARN notice in California, indicating the layoff of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale.

In 2024, the tech sector surpassed last year’s layoff figures, with over 42,324 workers losing their jobs.

This comes after nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, continuing the industry’s trend of job cuts. Major companies, including Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Discord, Salesforce Inc (NASDAQ:CRM), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) have announced significant layoffs in January.

Several factors contribute to this seemingly contradictory situation. Firstly, the rapid advancement in AI technology requires substantial investments in new technologies, prompting companies to reallocate resources and reduce their workforce.

GOOG shares gained 56% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via IShares Global Comm Services ETF (NYSE:IXP) and The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC).

Price Action: GOOG shares traded lower by 0.07% at $167.78 on the last check Tuesday.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has aggressively recruited dozens of artificial intelligence experts from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, establishing a secretive AI laboratory in Zurich, Europe.

This move comes as the company intensifies its efforts to lead in new AI model and product development.

Apple, valued at $2.7 trillion, has been expanding its global AI and Machine Learning team by poaching many specialists from Google since hiring John Giannandrea as its top AI executive in 2018.

This includes at least 36 experts who have since joined Apple, the Financial Times reports.

In addition to its central AI teams in California and Seattle, Apple has grown its presence in Zurich, Switzerland. This expansion followed the acquisitions of two local AI startups, leading to the creation of the “Vision Lab” in Zurich.

The Zurich team has contributed to research on advanced AI models that merge text and visual inputs, which are crucial for products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple has advertised several generative AI positions in Zurich, maintaining a low profile in the area.

The company plans to showcase new generative AI features at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, potentially transforming the next iPhone into a more sophisticated voice-activated assistant with an enhanced Siri capable of interacting with all apps via voice control.

Apple analysts projected a slight increase in revenue for the March quarter and a significant guide-down for the June quarter compared to consensus, followed by a negative market reaction.

The critical event following the earnings will be Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where analysts anticipate new AI software features will be a significant highlight, with Apple experiencing a relief rally.

Analysts will be closely watching the March quarter for total revenue, focusing on revenue from China (where he expects iPhone shipments to be down 28% year-over-year) and growth in Services revenue, which he projects at 12.7% year-over-year.

Apple stock gained over 2% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK).

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Alphabet Inc showcases robust revenue growth and a solid financial position.

Investments in AI and cloud computing signal future growth opportunities.

Regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges present ongoing threats.

Strategic acquisitions and partnerships could bolster market position.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has released its 10-Q filing on April 26, 2024, providing a detailed look into its financial performance and strategic positioning. The company continues to dominate the digital landscape with its comprehensive suite of internet services, advertising platforms, and technological innovations. A financial overview based on the latest SEC filing reveals a significant increase in revenues, from $69,787 million in the first quarter of 2023 to $80,539 million in the same period of 2024. Net income has also seen a substantial rise from $15,051 million to $23,662 million, indicating a strong financial trajectory. This SWOT analysis aims to dissect these financial highlights and delve into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape Alphabet Inc's current and future market standing.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with JNPR.

Strengths

Financial Performance and Brand Dominance: Alphabet Inc's recent financial results underscore its robust market position. The company's revenue surged by over 15% year-over-year, with net income jumping by a remarkable 57%. This financial prowess is underpinned by its dominant brand and diverse portfolio of services, including Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud. Alphabet's ability to consistently generate substantial income from operations, which increased from $17,415 million to $25,472 million, reflects its operational efficiency and the enduring appeal of its advertising platform, which remains the cornerstone of its revenue stream.

Innovation and Diversification: Alphabet Inc is not just resting on its laurels; the company is a beacon of innovation, particularly in AI and cloud computing. The 10-Q filing indicates a commitment to these areas, with expectations of increased capital expenditures to support growth, especially in AI products and services. This forward-thinking approach ensures Alphabet stays ahead in the technology race, diversifying its revenue streams beyond advertising and fortifying its long-term market position.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite its impressive financials, Alphabet Inc's heavy reliance on advertising dollars is a potential vulnerability. With over 85% of its revenue stemming from online ads, shifts in the advertising market or disruptions caused by ad-blocking technologies could significantly impact its bottom line. This dependence on a single revenue source, albeit a lucrative one, exposes Alphabet to market volatility and necessitates a strategic pivot towards more diversified income streams.

Regulatory and Legal Risks: Alphabet Inc's filing acknowledges the heightened regulatory scrutiny it faces, with ongoing legal matters and the possibility of substantial fines and penalties. These challenges not only pose a financial risk but also threaten to disrupt business practices and affect the company's reputation. As Alphabet navigates a complex global regulatory landscape, it must allocate resources judiciously to manage these risks effectively.

Opportunities

Expansion into Emerging Markets: Alphabet Inc's international performance is pivotal to its growth, with developing economies offering a vast untapped user base. As internet penetration deepens in these regions, Alphabet has the opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for digital services, potentially leading to significant revenue expansion and diversification.

Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: The company's robust balance sheet positions it well to pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships that can open new markets, enhance its product offerings, and consolidate its competitive edge. Alphabet's history of successful integrations, such as YouTube and Android, demonstrates its capability to leverage acquisitions for sustained growth and innovation.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The technology sector is characterized by rapid innovation and fierce competition. Alphabet Inc faces threats from existing tech giants and emerging startups that challenge its market share in core areas like advertising, search, and cloud services. Staying ahead requires continuous investment in R&D and a keen eye for evolving consumer preferences and technological trends.

Global Economic Uncertainty: Economic downturns and geopolitical tensions can lead to reduced advertising spending and consumer purchasing power, directly affecting Alphabet's revenue streams. The company's international operations also expose it to currency fluctuations and trade disputes, which can unpredictably impact financial performance.

In conclusion, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) presents a compelling case of a company with formidable strengths, including a solid financial foundation and a reputation for innovation. However, it must navigate the challenges of market dependence and regulatory pressures while seizing opportunities for international expansion and strategic acquisitions. The threats of competition and economic instability loom, but with prudent management and strategic foresight, Alphabet is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the digital age.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Markets rose Friday, boosted by earnings from Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., two of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, which both reported beats on revenue and earnings.

Microsoft's next quarter revenue outlook was higher than analyst expectations while Alphabet announced it would begin paying a $.20 a share dividend. Alphabet jumped more than 10% after the open and Microsoft rose over 2% in early trading Friday.

Rallies in the stocks boosted the broader markets, with the Nasdaq surging 2.2% and the S&P 500 adding about 1% midmorning. ETFs tracking the indexes gained similarly: SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust was 1.1% higher while QQQ, the Invesco QQQ Trust which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, popped 1.7%.

MAGS, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF which holds Mag 7 stocks in its fund soared more than 3%.

Microsoft and Alphabet's earnings surprises are helping improve the less-than-rosy picture painted earlier this earnings season by tech companies. Tech earnings have been in focus since last week as investors wondered if the megacap tech companies that have led the markets for so long would continue to do so in the future.

While Microsoft and Alphabet earnings delighted investors, Tesla Inc., Netflix Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. reported disappointing results that kept markets under pressure earlier in the week.

The Dow was little-changed, adding half a percentage point. DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust was up 0.2%.

The better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft and Alphabet helped investors look past inflation data released Friday. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March rose 0.3% for the month, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The monthly rise was in line with expectations from economists polled by Dow Jones. But the year-over-year rise of 2.7% (minus the volatile food and energy categories) highlighted how stubborn and persistent inflation has been.

The data came just a day after the Commerce Department released first quarter PCE figures, giving investors an advance preview of what was to come today. Thursday's advance reading of PCE torpedoed investor hopes that rate cuts were coming anytime soon.

PCE remains the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, and is a key piece of information for policy meetings about rate cuts. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady next week at the FOMC meeting, but questions still remain on when investors—and the economy—can anticipate relief from a high interest rate environment.",0.1696774193548387,0.4848924731182795,Positive,0.9999046325683594,0.4531615889001057

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. on Thursday released a quarterly report showing it’s still reaping double-digit revenue gains from its digital advertising empire while sowing potentially lucrative new ground in artificial intelligence.

The results for the first three months of the year provided the latest evidence that Google has regained its momentum after an unprecedented downturn in 2022 coming out of the pandemic.

Alphabet punctuated its renewed vigor by also disclosing plans to begin paying shareholders a quarterly dividend for the first time since since Google went public 20 years ago. It’s something that two older technology powerhouses, Microsoft and Apple, have been doing for years. Alphabet's quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share will be paid June 17.

Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro praised the decision to pay a dividend as “a breath of fresh air for the tech market” that should also make investors more likely to support the increased amounts that Google will likely need to spend on developing AI products that could take years to pay off.

In the January-March period, Alphabet’s revenue rose 15% from the same time last year to $80.54 billion, which surpassed the projections of analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year revenue growth for the Mountain View, California, company.

Alphabet earned $23.66 billion, or $1.89 per share, a 57% increase from last year's comparable quarter. The earnings per share also eclipsed the analyst estimates that steer investors.

“We are incredibly well set up, given the innovation path we are on,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday conference call.

The company's stock price soared by nearly 13% in Thursday's extended trading after the news came out. That reaction was a stark contrast to how investors responded to a report covering the same quarter from Facebook's parent. Meta Platforms also reported a surge in ad revenue but provided a disappointing outlook for the April-June period, while also warning its profits would be squeezed by increased spending on AI technology.

If Alphabet's shares move in a similar trajectory during Friday's regular trading session, the stock will hit a new all-time high that will push the company's market value above $2 trillion.

As has been the case since throughout the company's history, most of the money came in through a digital advertising network anchored by Google’s dominant search engine. Google’s ad revenue totaled $61.66 billion in the first quarter, up 13% from last year.

Despite the ongoing success, Google is facing dual threats that could threaten its future growth.

The U.S. Department of Justice is taking aim at its search engine a lawsuit alleging the company has abused its power by negotiating lucrative deals with Apple and other companies to give it an unfair advantage over potential rivals, stifling innovation as well as competition.

After a two-month trial last fall, the closing arguments in the biggest U.S. antitrust case in a quarter are scheduled to unfold next week and a federal judge is expected to rule whether Google has been breaking the law by the end of this year.

People also may not need to rely as much on Google’s search information to answer their questions and find other information as the artificial intelligence technology that Google, Microsoft and other industry stalwarts are building becomes more sophisticated. If AI gradually supplants the role that Google’s search engine has filled for the past quarter century, Alphabet’s ad sales also could dwindle.

For now, AI is helping to fuel rapid growth in Google’s cloud computing division, which saw its first-quarter revenue climb 28% from last year to $9.57 billion.

But the cloud division also has become a tinder box for Google management as dozens of employees have staged protests over a $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government that includes AI technology as part of Project Nimbus.

The protesting employees believe Project Nimbus is being lethally deployed by the Israeli military in the Gaza war — a contention Google has denied. The divisive issue came to head earlier this month during an employee sit-in at Google offices in Sunnyvale, California, and New York that resulted in more than 50 workers being fired.

Alphabet ended March with nearly 181,000 employees, a decrease of nearly 10,000 workers from the previous year. Management has cycled through several rounds of mass layoffs to help boost profits while Google ramps up its spending on AI technology.",0.0782348484848484,0.4246759906759905,Positive,0.9986159801483154,0.4331602030843449

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Markets were in the green Tuesday as earnings season kicked into high gear, giving investors what they needed to help snap a losing streak in the S&P 500.

Companies are largely reporting earnings and sales that top forecasts, boosting investors' enthusiasm. Among the 14% of the S&P 500 having reported results by last week's end, 74% said they beat earnings expectations and 58% reported revenue beats, according to data from FactSet.

SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust jumped more than 1% after the open on Tuesday while DIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust popped more than half of a percentage point.

All eyes are on tech earnings—particularly from the 'Magnificent Seven'—this week as Tesla Inc. gets ready to report earnings after the bell today. Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also on deck to report quarterly earnings this week.

QQQ, the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust soared 1.5% after the open on Tuesday. MAGS, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF which holds the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks rose roughly 1.6%.

Investors have been anxious for results from the Mag 7, looking for signs that the companies won't be able to sustain the levels of growth that have surpassed the broader market.

Year to date, MAGS has jumped more than 9%, and is roughly 48% higher than last year. In contrast, the S&P 500 has only risen 5% since the beginning of the year and 21% since last year.

Top gainers on Tuesday included NVDX, the T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF, and NVDL, the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF. Both ETFs jumped 5% and 7% respectively as investors geared up for earnings from the Mag 7. Investors will have to wait another month before NVIDIA reports.

CONL, the GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily ETF saw the biggest pop Tuesday, rising over 9% before paring some gains. The pop in the leveraged ETF which tracks Coinbase stock comes just days after the bitcoin halving, an event where the reward for bitcoin miners is halved, contributing to scarcity of the digital asset.

UBS Cautions In Tech Sector

UBS Group AG's chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub has advised caution on tech stocks.

As reported by Bloomberg, UBS downgraded its stance on the ‘Big 6’ technology giants—Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia Corp.— from Overweight to Neutral amid slowing earnings momentum.

Golub suggests that the downturn in tech earnings momentum will be driven by wider cyclical challenges, not by worries about valuations or the industry's prospects in artificial intelligence.

GOOGL,2025-04-22,"Uber Technologies, Inc’s (NYSE:UBER) Uber Eats is introducing a TikTok-style short-form video feature to enhance food discovery and enable restaurants to highlight their offerings more vividly.

This feature, which is currently undergoing testing in New York, San Francisco, and Toronto, represents Uber Eats’ foray into the burgeoning realm of short-form video content, aligning with a trend popularized by platforms like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Instagram, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), and recently Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) LinkedIn.

The feature showcases videos in a swipeable format, visible in carousels throughout the app, including the home screen, TechCrunch reports.

These videos aim to give users a closer look at food preparation, textures, portion sizes, and dish compositions, ultimately boosting consumer confidence in trying new dishes.

Notably, the content is offered to users based on the proximity of the restaurants, ensuring relevance and delivery feasibility.

Uber Eats’ approach differentiates from typical advertising; it doesn’t charge merchants for these video placements, offering a unique platform for restaurants to connect directly with potential customers.

This move is particularly significant as many restaurants leverage social media to attract new patrons and showcase their culinary creations.

Introducing this feature into the Uber Eats app aims to streamline the discovery process and encourage users to seek culinary inspiration within the app itself.

Uber Eats is also enhancing its support for merchants by revamping the Uber Eats Manager software with personalized growth recommendations and preparing to launch a new app for restaurant managers to facilitate on-the-go business management.

Prior reports indicated Microsoft’s LinkedIn testing a TikTok-like short-form video feed enabling users to interact with vertical short videos by liking, commenting, and sharing. This move by LinkedIn focuses on career-oriented and professional content.

Reports also suggested that Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) explore full-length music videos to appeal to the Gen Z audience. Meta expanded its short video offerings with the global launch of “Reels” in February 2022, while Google reported in June 2022 that YouTube “Shorts” had garnered over 1.5 billion logged-in monthly viewers. Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also entered the fray in August 2022, trialing a TikTok-like photo and video feed within its shopping app to facilitate product discovery.

Uber stock gained over 136% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSE:FPX) and Global X Millennial Consumer ETF (NASDAQ:MILN).

In 2013, four tech stocks stood out, earning the collective name, “FANG.” In 2017, the acronym expanded to encompass Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.

In 2023, the Magnificent 7 moniker emerged to describe an expanded group of tech stocks: Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Apple, Alphabet Inc. (formerly Google), Nvidia Corp., and Tesla.

But there’s another name savvy investors should know: GRANOLAS. These stocks don’t (necessarily) have anything to do with the crunchy treat preferred by hikers and healthy snack enthusiasts. Rather, they are 11 European-based companies that represent a broad cross-section of the market, ranging from luxury brands to biopharmaceutical companies.

In spite of being international brands, many are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet, they are not correlated strongly with the S&P 500, according to SeekingAlpha.com.

The stocks in the category are: GSK, Roche, ASML, Nestle, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, L’Oreal, LVMH, AstraZeneca, SAP, and Sanofi.

Today’s investors are finding multiple reasons to diversify their holdings into the GRANOLAS stocks.

GRANOLAS Stocks Have Outperformed the Market Since June 2022

This diverse collection of stocks has delivered 60% of the gains in the European stock market in the past year, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, and have outperformed the FAANG stocks for the past two years, Morningstar.com reported.

Plus, most of the stocks on the list deliver dividends of 2% to 2.5%.

They Provide Diversification

While tech stocks tend to fare well in the U.S., a portfolio made up of FAANG stocks doesn’t provide much diversification. On the other hand, the GRANOLAS stocks represent sectors ranging from consumer goods to fashion, technology and healthcare.

They also aren’t tied to the S&P 500 or Nasdaq index. If the bulk of your portfolio is filled with U.S.-based stocks, adding some shares of even a handful of the GRANOLAS could serve you well.

Because of the diversity of the companies on the list, the collection also shows less volatility than the Magnificent 7. “The realized volatility of the GRANOLAS is on average 2x lower than for the Magnificent 7,” Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer recently told SeekingAlpha.com.",0.2318046536796536,0.4068587662337662,Neutral,0.9984105825424194,0.4731705917329517

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. You can also check out the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Under $10 here.

Cloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.

The growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.

Currently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.

Even with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.

The Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.

Strategic focus on MongoDB Atlas and Enterprise Advanced to drive future expansion.

Competitive landscape intensifies with the evolution of database technologies.

Global economic uncertainties pose potential risks to MongoDB's growth trajectory.

On March 15, 2024, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) released its 10-K filing, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial performance and strategic positioning. Founded in 2007, MongoDB has established itself as a leading document-oriented database provider, serving nearly 33,000 paying customers and over 1.5 million free users. The company's financial tables reveal a year-over-year revenue increase from $1,284.04 million in 2023 to $1,683.01 million in 2024, with subscription services accounting for 97% of the total revenue. Despite the impressive revenue growth, MongoDB reported a net loss of $(176.60 million) in 2024, an improvement from the previous year's $(345.40 million). The company's strategic focus on MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, which represented 66% and 26% of total revenue respectively, underscores its commitment to expanding its market share in the database sector. However, the competitive landscape continues to evolve, and global economic uncertainties present potential risks to MongoDB's growth trajectory.

Strengths

Market Leadership and Revenue Growth: MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) has demonstrated a strong market presence with its innovative document-based database architecture, which has translated into robust revenue growth. The company's subscription revenue has seen a significant increase, rising from $1,235.12 million in 2023 to $1,627.33 million in 2024. This growth is primarily driven by MongoDB Atlas, which accounted for 66% of the total revenue in the fiscal year 2024. The platform's ability to meet the diverse needs of modern applications has positioned MongoDB as a leader in the NoSQL database market. The company's continued investment in product innovation, such as the introduction of new features and capabilities, has further solidified its competitive advantage and attracted a loyal customer base.

Strong Intellectual Property Portfolio: MongoDB Inc's strategic decision to own the intellectual property of its core offerings has allowed the company to maintain control over its product roadmap and differentiate itself from competitors. As of January 31, 2024, MongoDB held 77 issued patents in the United States, with an additional 35 patent applications pending. This robust intellectual property portfolio not only protects the company's innovations but also enhances its ability to monetize its offerings and secure a long-term competitive edge in the database software market.

Weaknesses

History of Net Losses: Despite its revenue growth, MongoDB Inc has reported a history of net losses, with a net loss of $(176.60 million) in 2024. This indicates a need for the company to improve its cost management and move towards profitability. The substantial investments in sales and marketing, which accounted for 47% of the total revenue, and research and development, which accounted for 31%, highlight the company's aggressive growth strategy. However, this approach has yet to yield a profitable outcome, suggesting that MongoDB may need to reassess its spending to achieve a more sustainable financial model.

Dependence on MongoDB Atlas: The company's reliance on MongoDB Atlas as a significant revenue source could be a potential weakness. While MongoDB Atlas has been a growth driver, accounting for 66% of the total revenue, this dependence makes the company vulnerable to any disruptions or competitive pressures that may affect the platform's performance. Diversifying revenue streams could mitigate this risk and provide a more stable financial foundation for MongoDB Inc.

Opportunities

Expansion into Emerging Markets: MongoDB Inc has the opportunity to expand its global footprint, particularly in emerging markets where digital transformation is accelerating. With 46% of its revenue generated outside the United States in 2024, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for database solutions worldwide. By leveraging its existing partnerships and cultivating new relationships, MongoDB can tap into new customer segments and drive international growth.

Leveraging AI and Machine Learning: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities into MongoDB's offerings presents a significant opportunity for the company. As businesses increasingly seek to harness the power of AI and ML for data analysis and decision-making, MongoDB can enhance its platform to meet these evolving needs. By pioneering industry-first encrypted search schemes and integrating with AI services from major cloud providers, MongoDB is poised to lead the market in AI-driven database solutions.

Threats

Intensifying Competition: The database software market is rapidly evolving, with new entrants and established players vying for market share. MongoDB Inc faces stiff competition from legacy providers like IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle, as well as cloud providers offering database services. These competitors have significant financial and technical resources, which could challenge MongoDB's market position. The company must continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive edge.

Global Economic Uncertainties: MongoDB Inc's growth prospects could be impacted by global economic uncertainties, including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and geopolitical risks. Such conditions could lead to reduced IT spending and delay business investments, adversely affecting MongoDB's revenue and expansion plans. The company must navigate these challenges carefully to sustain its growth trajectory.

In conclusion, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) exhibits a strong market position with its innovative database solutions and impressive revenue growth. The company's robust intellectual property portfolio and strategic focus on product development are key strengths that position it well for future success. However, MongoDB's history of net losses and dependence on MongoDB Atlas are areas

Challenges in maintaining service level commitments amidst rapid scaling.

International operations expose the company to geopolitical risks.

On May 31, 2024, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB), a leader in document-oriented database solutions, filed its 10-Q report, revealing a detailed look into its financial performance and strategic positioning. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, MongoDB Inc has demonstrated resilience with a notable increase in subscription revenue from $354,714 in 2023 to $436,896 in 2024. The company's commitment to investing in sales and marketing is evident, with a substantial portion of operating expenses allocated to these areas. However, the company's rapid growth trajectory has put pressure on its ability to maintain service level commitments, a factor critical to customer satisfaction and retention. Furthermore, MongoDB Inc's extensive international operations expose it to the risks associated with geopolitical tensions and economic instability, which could impact its global revenue streams.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with TGT.

Strengths

Robust Subscription Revenue Growth: MongoDB Inc's strength lies in its impressive subscription revenue growth, which has surged from $354,714 in 2023 to $436,896 in 2024. This growth is indicative of the company's successful land-and-expand strategy, where it focuses on not only acquiring new customers but also expanding its footprint within existing customer bases. The ability to consistently grow its annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and monthly recurring revenue (MRR) reflects the company's strong market position and the high demand for its NoSQL database solutions.

Strategic Sales and Marketing Investments: MongoDB Inc has made significant investments in its sales and marketing efforts, which have been instrumental in driving customer acquisition and retention. With operating expenses in sales and marketing reaching $219,444 in 2024, the company has demonstrated a clear strategy to fuel growth through targeted outreach and customer engagement initiatives. These investments have not only helped in increasing the number of customers with $100,000 or greater in ARR and annualized MRR but also in maintaining a net ARR expansion rate consistently over 120%, showcasing the company's ability to grow its customer base and deepen relationships with existing clients.

Weaknesses

Service Level Commitment Pressures: As MongoDB Inc scales rapidly, maintaining its service level commitments has become a challenge. The company's MongoDB Enterprise Advanced customers expect guaranteed response times and comprehensive coverage, while MongoDB Atlas users demand high uptime. Any failure to meet these commitments could significantly affect customer satisfaction, potentially leading to customer attrition and negatively impacting the company's reputation and financial health.

Dependence on MongoDB Atlas: With more than the majority of MongoDB Inc's revenue derived from MongoDB Atlas, the company's financial performance is heavily reliant on the success of this offering. While this dependence underscores the strength of MongoDB Atlas in the market, it also poses a risk. Any issues with customer satisfaction, competitive pressures, or technological shifts could disproportionately affect the company's overall performance and growth prospects.

Opportunities

Expanding Cloud Infrastructure: The ongoing shift towards cloud computing presents MongoDB Inc with significant opportunities to expand its MongoDB Atlas services. Partnerships with cloud infrastructure providers, like the one with Tencent Cloud, enable MongoDB Inc to reach a broader global audience and capitalize on the growing demand for cloud-based database solutions. This expansion strategy can lead to increased market share and revenue in the rapidly growing cloud services sector.

International Market Penetration: MongoDB Inc's international operations, which account for a substantial portion of its revenue, offer a pathway for growth outside the United States. By continuing to adapt and localize its offerings for specific countries and regions, MongoDB Inc can tap into new markets, diversify its revenue streams, and mitigate the risks associated with over-reliance on any single market.

Threats

Macroeconomic Instability: The company has acknowledged the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment on the growth of existing Atlas applications, which has affected revenue growth. With expectations that these conditions will persist, MongoDB Inc faces the threat of reduced technology spending by clients, potentially leading to slower revenue growth and challenges in customer acquisition and expansion.

Geopolitical Risks: MongoDB Inc's international presence exposes it to geopolitical risks, including trade laws, political instability, and economic sanctions. These factors can lead to decreased use of MongoDB Inc's offerings or limitations on its ability to export or sell its products, adversely affecting its operations and financial results. Additionally, the company must navigate the complexities of operating in multiple legal and regulatory environments, which can increase costs and operational challenges.

In conclusion, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) exhibits a strong financial foundation with robust subscription revenue growth and strategic investments in sales and marketing. However, the company must address the pressures of maintaining service level commitments and its heavy reliance on MongoDB Atlas. Opportunities in cloud infrastructure expansion and international markets are promising, but MongoDB Inc must carefully manage the threats posed by macroeconomic instability and geopolitical risks. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, MongoDB Inc can capitalize on the opportunities and mitigate the threats in its path, positioning itself for sustained growth and success in the competitive database market.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with TGT.

Strengths

Robust Subscription Revenue Growth: MongoDB Inc's strength lies in its impressive subscription revenue growth, which has surged from $354,714 in 2023 to $436,896 in 2024. This growth is indicative of the company's successful land-and-expand strategy, where it focuses on not only acquiring new customers but also expanding its footprint within existing customer bases. The ability to consistently grow its annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and monthly recurring revenue (MRR) reflects the company's strong market position and the high demand for its NoSQL database solutions.

Strategic Sales and Marketing Investments: MongoDB Inc has made significant investments in its sales and marketing efforts, which have been instrumental in driving customer acquisition and retention. With operating expenses in sales and marketing reaching $219,444 in 2024, the company has demonstrated a clear strategy to fuel growth through targeted outreach and customer engagement initiatives. These investments have not only helped in increasing the number of customers with $100,000 or greater in ARR and annualized MRR but also in maintaining a net ARR expansion rate consistently over 120%, showcasing the company's ability to grow its customer base and deepen relationships with existing clients.

Weaknesses

Service Level Commitment Pressures: As MongoDB Inc scales rapidly, maintaining its service level commitments has become a challenge. The company's MongoDB Enterprise Advanced customers expect guaranteed response times and comprehensive coverage, while MongoDB Atlas users demand high uptime. Any failure to meet these commitments could significantly affect customer satisfaction, potentially leading to customer attrition and negatively impacting the company's reputation and financial health.

Dependence on MongoDB Atlas: With more than the majority of MongoDB Inc's revenue derived from MongoDB Atlas, the company's financial performance is heavily reliant on the success of this offering. While this dependence underscores the strength of MongoDB Atlas in the market, it also poses a risk. Any issues with customer satisfaction, competitive pressures, or technological shifts could disproportionately affect the company's overall performance and growth prospects.

Opportunities

Expanding Cloud Infrastructure: The ongoing shift towards cloud computing presents MongoDB Inc with significant opportunities to expand its MongoDB Atlas services. Partnerships with cloud infrastructure providers, like the one with Tencent Cloud, enable MongoDB Inc to reach a broader global audience and capitalize on the growing demand for cloud-based database solutions. This expansion strategy can lead to increased market share and revenue in the rapidly growing cloud services sector.

International Market Penetration: MongoDB Inc's international operations, which account for a substantial portion of its revenue, offer a pathway for growth outside the United States. By continuing to adapt and localize its offerings for specific countries and regions, MongoDB Inc can tap into new markets, diversify its revenue streams, and mitigate the risks associated with over-reliance on any single market.

Threats

Macroeconomic Instability: The company has acknowledged the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment on the growth of existing Atlas applications, which has affected revenue growth. With expectations that these conditions will persist, MongoDB Inc faces the threat of reduced technology spending by clients, potentially leading to slower revenue growth and challenges in customer acquisition and expansion.

Geopolitical Risks: MongoDB Inc's international presence exposes it to geopolitical risks, including trade laws, political instability, and economic sanctions. These factors can lead to decreased use of MongoDB Inc's offerings or limitations on its ability to export or sell its products, adversely affecting its operations and financial results. Additionally, the company must navigate the complexities of operating in multiple legal and regulatory environments, which can increase costs and operational challenges.

In conclusion, MongoDB Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) exhibits a strong financial foundation with robust subscription revenue growth and strategic investments in sales and marketing. However, the company must address the pressures of maintaining service level commitments and its heavy reliance on MongoDB Atlas. Opportunities in cloud infrastructure expansion and international markets are promising, but MongoDB Inc must carefully manage the threats posed by macroeconomic instability and geopolitical risks. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, MongoDB Inc can capitalize on the opportunities and mitigate the threats in its path, positioning itself for sustained growth and success in the competitive database market.
